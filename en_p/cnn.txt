{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/wagyumafia-restaurants-japan/index.html", "title": "Wagyumafia: Japan's hottest restaurant brand sells $185 steak sandwich", "content": "(CNN) — Welcoming diners such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, sporting icon David Beckham and superstar musician Ed Sheeran would be enough to make any restaurateur weep with joy.\n\nBut for Hisato Hamada, the 42-year-old co-founder of Tokyo's white-hot Wagyumafia restaurant brand, which serves the world's finest cuts of Kobe beef, it's all in a day's work. Well, around a month's, to be precise.\n\nThe three headline-makers all visited Wagyumafia's The Butcher's Kitchen restaurant in the span of just a few weeks, all happily posing alongside Hamada -- and his trademark $185 Chateaubriand steak sandwich.\n\nRelated content 16 Japan experiences every traveler needs to enjoy\n\nIn fact, Beckham is such a fan that whenever he's in Hong Kong or Tokyo, he visits one of the Wagyumafia restaurants. He even flew Hamada to Indonesia to cook at a private family party.\n\nThey're not alone. Movie director Guy Ritchie and Russian DJ Zedd have also happily tucked in.\n\nDuring the recent Rugby World Cup, giants of the game jostled to get one of the restaurants' coveted nightly seats.\n\nEven Ed Sheeran's a fan of the Katsu Sando. Courtesy of Wagyumafia\n\nA raucous evening -- if you can get in\n\nWagyumafia currently has five restaurants. These include a special outlet for their $180 \"sando\" Chateaubriand sandwich, a new spot for yakiniku where you cook your own beef on a grill, and their flagship space in swanky Akasaka.\n\nThey also have one outpost in Hong Kong and another soon to launch in Manila -- with more to come.\n\nWagyumafia's success can be owed to a mix of often raucous Japanese restaurant hospitality, some of the world's most exclusive and expensive cuts of beef -- and very smart marketing.\n\nReservations in Wagyumafia's five compact restaurants are very hard to come by, not least because three of them are open for members only (memberships can be purchased online when reserving at table, currently for 15,000 yen.)\n\nWhen you get there, don't expect a romantic meal for two.\n\nBlaring soundtracks of everything from soul and hip-hop to rock anthems and cheesy pop classics make for a full-on environment where you invariably end up singing along.\n\nCopious optional amounts of alcohol, be it champagne, beer, sake or highball cocktails, help to ensure that proceedings often carry on much later than you'd expect.\n\nHamada himself is much of the draw, a gregarious host who makes an evening fly by, explaining the dishes and story behind the stellar Kobe beef.\n\nThe Kobe beef back story\n\nAll of this begs the question: Is the beef really that good?\n\nThe Kobe beef served at Wagyumafia certainly has a storied history.\n\nThe word \"wagyu,\" seen frequently on global menus, translates simply as \"Japanese cattle.\" This broad umbrella term encompasses four official breeds: the Japanese black, the Japanese brown, the Japanese poll and the Japanese shorthorn.\n\nThe Japanese black is the most common and has three bloodlines but, among them, Tajima cattle have historically been isolated deep in the mountains, meaning they avoided cross-breeding with foreign animals.\n\nCourtesy of Wagyumafia\n\nAs a result, only pure-blood Tajima cattle bred, raised and slaughtered in Japan's Hyogo prefecture can today be called Kobe beef. Only 4,500 or so cattle are certified every year, the vast majority of which are served to the domestic Japanese market, including Wagyumafia.\n\nScarce space for grazing is another issue in Japan, which, along with a lack of stress, helps the cattle to develop its famed marbled fat.\n\nGenerally, the more marbling the better, as it makes the meat both tender and flavorful. The highest-grade USDA beef features around 6-8% of marbled fat, but in the highest quality Kobe beef served at Wagyumafia and elsewhere, it can reach a whopping 25%.\n\nRelated content 25 Japanese foods we love -- from tempura to miso\n\nIf that sounds difficult to digest, it's worth noting that cuts of Kobe beef are generally much smaller than their US counterparts, while their fat is also largely monounsaturated.\n\nTastewise, people often remark on the sweetness of the meat, with vanilla one of the flavor profiles most frequently mentioned. As for texture -- well, you barely need a knife to cut it.\n\nThe Kobe auction\n\nKobe beef auctions are steeped in tradition. Chris Dwyer/CNN\n\nA visit to the 101st Kobe beef auction -- one of only two Kobe beef auctions in Japan -- held recently in a small village in the mountains an hour north of the city of Kobe reveals much about why the meat is so prized.\n\nThe first thing one notices is the quiet. There is almost no mooing from the dozens of calm animals, while the auction space is pretty much spotless -- and mercifully lacking in traditional farmyard odors.\n\nThe cattle have been pretty much hand-raised by local farmers on smallholdings or in barns, usually of no more than 100-150 cows, meaning that they are used to interacting with humans. As they grow, they are fed a succession of milk, milk supplements, corn and special mixes.\n\nContrary to the many myths out there, they're never fed beer, given massages or played classical music.\n\nThis Kobe auction, which dates back to 1909, is steeped in tradition. Inside the compact amphitheater, three auctioneers in orange robes and red caps work at dizzying speeds to manage bids from dozens of buyers sat in rows, each of whom hold numbered paddles.\n\nStaff at the front and back of the room flick through numbers on large ring-bound papers, which are on display for bidders. One cow is purchased by London's famed department store Harrods, then a sale goes to a buyer in Mexico before Wynn Las Vegas snaps one up.\n\nQuaint touches abound. At every buyer's seat sits a small carton of milk to toast the start of around two hours of bidding.\n\nThe local farmers, who have hand-raised the animals for up to five years, stand at the front of the auction before thanking the eventual buyer with gifts that may include orchids, fruit or a bottle of sake.\n\n$92,000 for the top lot\n\nBidding heats up for the most coveted champion prize-winning breeds, resplendent in special purple cloaks with gold-colored trim, which are led in front of the crowd.\n\nAs buyers puff on cigarettes, break out into laughter and occasional applause, bids increase by one million yen -- around $9,200 -- at a time, until finally the 1,700-pound \"Grand Champion Steer\" is claimed for 10 million yen, or around $92,000.\n\nWagyumafia's Hamada buys the second most expensive cow of the day for a cool $65,000. In total, he says he buys around 100 full Kobe cattle each year for his growing restaurant empire.\n\nThe real deal\n\nHisato Hamada, the 42-year-old co-founder of Wagyumafia, is a self-taught chef-turned-wagyu expert. Courtesy Wagyumafia\n\nBack in Tokyo at Wagyumafia in the chic neighborhood of Akasaka, a small bronze statue of a Tajima cow certifies the authenticity of the Kobe. In fact, any restaurant serving the real deal has to be certified and have the Kobe association's official seal on display.\n\nThat includes overseas restaurants. (If you thought you'd eaten Kobe beef outside Japan before 2012, you were misled -- that's the first year a shipment was exported outside the country.)\n\nWhen it comes to serving the beef, Hamada is adamant about his nose-to-tail philosophy, meaning that every part of the animal is used.\n\n\"Being a chef is about paying respect and appreciation to an animal's life,\" he says. \"Nothing must be left over when you eat, to show respect to the animal.\"\n\nHe explains that his favorite way to enjoy it is grilled simply over binchotan charcoal: \"No salt, no pepper, no sauce. It just doesn't need it.\"\n\nHamada and his team of chefs prepare it in a multitude of ways, from homemade beef jerky, sashimi and beef tail soup to tenderloin served with soy sauce that has been barrel-aged for eight years.\n\nRelated content Welcome to Sendai, beef tongue capital of the world\n\nMost famous, however, is his \"Katsu Sando,\" a Japanese take on the steak sandwich. While you can choose your cut of Kobe at different price points, it's the Chateaubriand cut at 20,000 yen ($185) that has set Instagram alight.\n\nBefore frying, the meat is coated in a breadcrumb mix known as \"panko\" in Japanese, which is made from five different breads. Milk bread is lightly toasted and their very special steak sauce -- made from ingredients including 20-year aged Kamebishi soy sauce and Fuji vinegar from Kyoto -- is smeared just so, to give a tangy counterpoint.\n\nThe final flourish? That unique and very Instagram-friendly way it is served, thrust towards you on a plate, the server staring intently behind it.\n\nSet to expand\n\nAs for the megastar celebrities, many of whom have now become his friends, Hamada simply says that they love to eat like anyone else.\n\nIn total, Hamada wants to set up around 10 Wagyumafia restaurants around the world - including in the United States. He's certainly not short of offers, telling us he gets two or three partnership enquiries a day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019-11-12 00:04:04", "images": ["https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191112091950-wagyumafia-sando-ed-sheeran.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190130115532-wagyumafia-hong-kong1.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F171220172042-best-beaches-promo.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191111163246-wagyumafia-doubledecker-super-tease.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191111173651-hisato-hamada-wagyumafia.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191111171717-kobe-auction.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191111162859-kobe-beef-wagyu.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["foodanddrink", "Wagyumafia: Japan's hottest restaurant brand sells $185 steak sandwich  - CNN"], "tags": "index.html"}

Children will not be counted.\n\nMayor Antonio Diana, who announced the move, told CNN that recently during the summer, there can be as many as 6,000 people on the beach per day.\n\n\"We're limiting numbers because the burden is too much,\" he said. \"We need to safeguard it so that we can guarantee its life for the next 500 years.\n\n\"This is the most popular beach on Sardinia -- everyone wants to come here. But it's a very precarious geological equilibrium, so we're doing this work to guarantee its future.\n\n\"Six thousand people is not sustainable anymore.\"\n\n$4.40 to save the beach\n\nBefore taking the decision, the council commissioned studies to determine how many visitors the beach could take without being damaged.\n\nThe authorities have not yet confirmed how the tickets will be assigned -- they are looking into the possibility of an app, said the mayor. \"We don't know how much the ticket will cost, but we think it'll be around 4 euros [$4.40] per day,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"We have a slogan: 'La Pelosa una volta ma per tutti,' for everyone but one time only.

Trainees attend school - where they learn to cook, make drinks, work front of house as well as attend English classes. The trainees can then apply those skills working at the restaurants.\n\nThe social enterprise, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, has served more than one million guests, including dignitaries such as former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\n\nA KOTO student sports a branded black T-shirt while working. Courtesy KOTO\n\n'I am grown'\n\nWe met 20-year-old Uyen at KOTO's flagship restaurant in Hanoi.\n\nOriginally from southern Vietnam, she dropped out of university after her mother got ill and began looking for a job to help pay the bills. Her friend had approached her about joining KOTO, but it seemed too good to be true.\n\n\"The first time I don't believe in KOTO and [neither did] my family,\" she tells CNN Travel . \"Because no place open for you and is totally free -- and gives you the money and lots of activities and only just good for you.\"\n\nBut seeing her friend so happy working there after six months, she joined the program.\n\nNow in her second year, Uyen says her life has turned around.\n\n\"I think this is my dreams. I think KOTO not only teach you the job, not only teach you how to work, KOTO also teach you how to be the good human.\"\n\nUyen says not only has KOTO helped her develop skills, it has also helped her learn how to live as part of society.\n\n\"KOTO help me through the lesson, the environment. I think KOTO have many people and I have to talk with them and I have to work with them. I have to think how can I work with them and how can I study and how can I develop.\"\n\nShe also has a dream -- hoping one day to make it as a bartender.\n\nAs for her family, they are proud. She tells CNN, \"I think they are very happy when they see me now, they told me 'Wow, you are grown.'\"\n\nThe inaugural KOTO graduating class in 1999. Courtesy KOTO\n\nFinding success\n\nThao Nguyen is the general manager of KOTO - but her story with the social enterprise began decades ago. Nguyen is a graduate of KOTO's charter class.\n\nNguyen left school at the age of 13 to help her family earn a living. For two years, she sold iced tea around Hoàn Kiếm Lake in the summers and postcards on the streets when the weather got cold.\n\n\"While I was selling postcards to tourists, I got to know an Australian lady, \"says Nguyen. \"She asked me that what do I want in the future and where do I see myself in the future. To be honest, on that day, I had no idea.\"\n\nThe Australian woman, a diplomat, introduced Nguyen to a new program called KOTO and, Nguyen says, it changed her life.\n\nA quiet moment as KOTO team members prepare to open the restaurant for the day. Courtesy KOTO\n\n\"I will say that the best time of my life is a time that I was a KOTO trainee because it was also the first time I got a sense of belonging and also many memorable experiences I would take for life.\"\n\nAfter graduating from KOTO, Nguyen went on to pursue a successful career in hospitality, returning to the social enterprise in 2017.\n\n\"It's my second family and I'm so, so happy to be back with my family now,\" she says.\n\nLike Nguyen, many of KOTO's graduates are living success stories -- the social enterprise says that every single one of their graduates has gone on to find employment after finishing the KOTO program. Many now work at top hotels and restaurants around Vietnam and globally, while others have started their own businesses.\n\nEmployees work the line in the Hanoi KOTO kitchen. Courtesy KOTO\n\nKnow one, teach forever\n\nNguyen says it is challenging to run a business as well as fulfill its social mission.\n\nCurrently, they pay for the welfare, healthcare, accommodation as well as training for KOTO's current 150 trainees. In addition, KOTO also employs around 100 staff members and volunteers.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, Nguyen believes KOTO's social mission is clear -- to instill the spirit of giving back and paying it forward in their trainees and the people around them.\n\n\"The philosophy of KOTO is if you know one, you should teach one.

{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/dining-out-sharing-food-or-not/index.html", "title": "Share food orders or keep it all to yourself? CNN's dining out debate", "content": "(CNN) — Going out to eat is one of life's greatest joys. There's no grocery shopping, cooking or cleaning up involved. Restaurant dining allows you to sit back and let someone else do the hard part.\n\nAll you have to do is order and eat.\n\nBut about that ordering bit: It's not as straightforward as it used to be. With share plate dining all the rage at restaurants around the world, you may not be in the \"When Harry Met Sally\" territory of \"I'll have what she's having.\" Or you might be.\n\nTwo CNN Travel editors duke it out over sharing food versus, well, not sharing.\n\nA CASE FOR SHARING\n\nA veteran restaurant-goer, Stacey Lastoe knows her way around the menu. In spite of a recent Eater argument against perusing menus online beforehand, she can't help herself and prides herself on being a quick enough study to place a drink order during the first step of service (a.k.a. water service). Ordering items for the table to share -- whether for a party of two or eight -- is not only the best way to enjoy a meal out, but it is also the best way to control the pace of the evening. An exception can be made for burgers. When Lastoe's burger craving strikes, sharing is a nonstarter.\n\nStacey Lastoe calls herself a \"really good orderer\" and promises that if you go down the sharing road with her, you won't be disappointed. Stacey Lastoe\n\nPicture this. You and your party sit down to dinner. The server comes by, first attempting to upsell you on the water — \"sparkling, still or tap?\" (the word tap is barely audible; blink and you miss it) — and the savviest diner (me) in the group immediately knows what to do: \"Tap is great, thanks.\"\n\nOf course, depending on where you're dining, your selection may vary. Here in New York City, the answer is almost always tap.\n\nAfter water is poured and drink orders taken, your table will likely be regaled with a rendition of the popular \"how the menu works\" tune. While I pretend to pay attention to this, I'm secretly plotting my table's order.\n\nRelated content How early do you get to the airport? The great timing debate\n\nSo. Many. Categories.\n\nNow there are still a handful of establishments that offer clearly stated courses -- appetizer, entree, dessert -- but many more want you to \"experience\" the menu, to taste around the various categories.\n\nThese categories may include but are not limited to \"hot, cold, small bites, raw, bread, noodles, main, big appetites, for the table.\"\n\nI could go on, but I'll spare you. If you go out to eat even a couple of times a year, you're probably familiar with this insistence on relegating menu items to very specific sections along with instructions on how many items to order from each. This, by the way, if not clearly stated as it most often is, is code for: We encourage sharing.\n\nPachamama East in London has a menu designed for sharing. Pachamama East\n\nAnd I encourage efficient ordering. As a former front-of-house restaurant employee, nothing pains me more now as a diner than sitting idly while a member of my party struggles to make a decision.\n\nA seasoned server will accurately read the situation and attempt to move on to one of a thousand other things they have to do during service, but not before the worst offender waffles some more and says urgently: \"don't go anywhere! I'll just be a minute.\"\n\nA really good orderer\n\nI have my flaws, but I know my strengths, which is why I can confidently say: I am a really good orderer. Faced with an indecisive group or individual, I like to offer my assistance by suggesting we just share everything. I feel good about this approach even when the menu isn't definitively designed for sharing. I also know not to, uh, order the salmon at the steakhouse.\n\nAt Cote, a Korean steakhouse in NYC, the menu items are best shared. Gary He\n\n\"I'm happy to order for the table,\" I'll say, adding, depending on the people I'm with, \"Feel free to tell me your menu must-haves.\" I'll oblige desires to have the cod fish filet even if I have a hunch it's going to be the weak link of the order as fish filets always are (unless you're eating at Le Bernardin, which recently was awarded a coveted three Michelin stars rating -- but that's another story).\n\nOrdering in this manner is not only the best way to move the meal along at a logical pace. It's also the best way to ensure everyone's satisfied and sated.\n\nThe spiels from waitstaff about tasting around the menu are tired, I get it, but the intention is on point. Truly the best way to dine is to try as many things as possible (knowing what to avoid).\n\nAn individual cannot reasonably order and eat multiple appetizers and more than one entree plus dessert.\n\nBut even two diners who opt to share are guaranteed a more diverse, pleasing dining experience.\n\nWhen you share, you also avoid that awkward but inevitable offer to your dining companions: \"Would you like to try a bite?\" even if giving up a single bite of your lobster noodles is the last thing on Earth you want to do.\n\nSharing makes this a nonissue.\n\nI suppose it also promotes a sense of community around the table in a way reaching across the table to stab a piece of Wagyu steak from your friend's plate never will. Plus it makes bill splitting a cinch.\n\nRelated content To check or carry on? Luggage choices get heated\n\nA CASE FOR NOT SHARING\n\nGrowing up in 1980s Los Angeles, Brekke Fletcher spent her formative years dining at restaurants. She is an expert editor/taste maker who routinely orders the best thing on the menu. Fletcher's ninth birthday party, held at My Brother's BBQ in Woodland Hills, California, still haunts her. Having ordered a whole rack of ribs for herself, only to witness her friends and family eat them one by one while wearing a pristine plastic bib, with the only the detritus of a lackluster potato salad to sate her. After years of frustration and disappointment, Fletcher decided to stop sharing her food. She has never looked back.\n\nBrekke Fletcher doesn't believe in sharing food with her dining companions. This way she actually gets to eat the rack of ribs she ordered. Brekke Fletcher\n\nI don't share! I don't share!\n\nDon't blame me. Blame the squash blossoms. There were three in an order, and the Generalisimo running things at dinner had determined we would share everything that night. He also ordered several other small plates, none of which had me rapt and salivating like the squash blossoms.\n\nThe plates arrived on the table one by one. I had a taste of the white bean salad, a few beets with faro, waiting for those most delicate, ricotta-filled, lightly fried blossoms. When the server slid the plate to the center of the table, I felt my heart flutter. Then something happened.\n\nFour adult humans, armed with borrowed forks and knives, started tearing these beauties apart. Ricotta flew, bits of fried squash shot off the plate, and while I tried to salvage one decent bite from the carnage, I said aloud, \"You know what? I -- insert expletive here -- hate sharing.\"\n\nI flagged down the server to put in another order of squash blossoms, to be eaten this time with the reverence and respect they deserved, by me alone.\n\nI am 'that guy'\n\nVirtus in Paris' monkfish in a watercress, curry and coconut sauce -- a dish Fletcher wouldn't be inclined to share with the table. Courtesy Thomas Duval\n\nWith the proliferation of \"family style\" ordering, I find myself in a bit of a quandary. I do not want to be that guy. The one who won't share or puts the kibosh on plans to eat at restaurants that specialize in plates meant \"for the table.\"\n\nAnd yet, if I'm going out to eat and spending my money and calories on food that a) I may or may not want and b) that wouldn't split four ways with a top surgeon and a sharp scalpel?\n\nNo, I do not want 1/6 of a meatball, just to say I tasted it.\n\nTwo pieces of a Hamachi scallion roll, so Sharey McGivememore over there can try a substandard Philadelphia roll? How do you say, \"no,\" in Japanese? (PS: I Googled \"how to say no in Japanese,\" and there is not a single answer to that question.)\n\nI love food. All food. And yes, I, too, want to taste all the things. You can commonly hear me say the following Dickensian rip-off prior to dining, \"I regret that I have but one stomach to give to my dinner.\"\n\nRelated content Hotel room or vacation rental? The accommodation debate\n\nOrdering for me, myself and I\n\nBut when it comes to some menus and certain dining companions, I insist on ordering for me, myself and I alone.\n\nDoes this mean I won't offer a bite of my food? No. Does that mean I won't request a bite of yours? No. Does this make me a horrible person? Jury's out.\n\nSo there. I said it. I do not like to share.\n\nThat is unless you and I are food related -- in that we eat and love all of the same things with equal measure and gusto.\n\nI know this won't make a popular group dining date, but I also know what makes me happy, what I want to order, and what I don't want to order.\n\nAnd I will act according to my own desires and not those of the group in this one scenario, and I'm sorry (not sorry).

Empowered and at peace. Energized and edified.\n\nJust over an hour by plane from Hanoi, Quy Nhon has remained largely undiscovered by international travelers, most opting to follow a worn path to Vietnam destinations such as Hue, Hoi An and Sapa -- often with a final stop in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe coastal city's relative tranquility adds to its allure, and the five-star Anantara, which opened in December 2018, makes it absolutely worthy of a visit.\n\nReasons for Quy Nhon's under-the-radar status aren't easily articulated given its general appeal: It's a culturally rich destination in its own right. It boasts miles of coastline, fresh cuisine reliant on its seaside location and a handful of accommodations priced for all tastes and budgets.\n\nThere's a small national museum (the war photos may be the most interesting part), empty beaches (most locals prefer the beach at night to avoid the oppressive daytime sun and heat), a bustling market, thriving cafe culture, ruins and pagodas.\n\nIt has everything a discerning traveler could want -- minus the huge crowds and inflated prices.\n\nExtraordinary luxury\n\nA stay at Anantara Quy Nhon is about as luxe as it gets. Quy Nhon Anantara Villas\n\nA stay in one of Anantara Quy Nhon's pool villas is about as luxe as it gets.\n\nThere are more centrally located hotels, but the views or vibe won't be the same as a stay along the private beach in front of the Bay of Quy Nhon.\n\nAnantara is remote but still just a 10-minute walk to several other spots along this quieter part of the beach.\n\nFirst, take some time to settle in. Each villa's amenities include a fridge stocked with complimentary cheese, charcuterie and chocolate bars and a sparkling oversized tub that beckons with bath salts and more of that unbelievable view.\n\nPanoramic ocean or beachfront villas designed with floor-to-ceiling windows and doors for breathtaking views that stretch beyond a meticulously decorated and detailed room are so warm and inviting, you might never want to leave.\n\nThat is, until you get a whiff of what's on offer outside the property.\n\nExperience driven\n\nThe Cham ruins are part of the My Son historic site. Getty Images/Demetrio Carrasco\n\nIt's a testament to Quy Nhon's diversity and charms that there's so much to see and do beyond the confines of your hotel room.\n\nBackpackers staying up the beach at one of the budget accommodations may inspire you to rent a motorbike -- a Vietnam staple for getting around -- and explore on your own, but there's no shame in casting your cares aside and succumbing to the thoughtful Anantara tour program.\n\nStart with a visit to the Banh It Towers, one of four Cham ruins sites in the area. This is where Vijaya, the Cham capital, existed until 1471 when the north took over.\n\nThe only way up to the crumbling brick red towers is via stairs on foot.\n\nThe view from the top vantage point offers excellent views of the city, the sprawling countryside and the ocean. And you won't have to fight the crowds to get a close look -- these are seldom visited sites, and you may even have the serene place all to yourself. (The Binh Dinh Museum in Quy Nhon offers additional information on the Cham sites.)\n\nAfter you've had enough of the ruins, ask your guide (or Google Maps) to direct you to the pagodas, set on immaculate grounds with intricate Japanese-imported landscaping.\n\nTaking pictures inside the solemn Buddha-filled spaces is not allowed, but paying respects with an incense offering is encouraged. According to Mai Vu Bao, an Anantara villa host who loves taking guests on tours and practicing his British English, you don't want to risk getting ghosts and spirits in your photos.\n\nA stay at Anantara is akin to staying on a private island, yet there's so much to do outside the resort. Quy Nhon Anantara Villas\n\nFollowing the ruins and pagoda tours, we recommend going for a spa treatment in the middle of an ocean-facing jungle.\n\nAvani, Anantara's sister property with a bohemian vibe, is lorded over by Bach Thi Anh Dao, a Quy Nhon local who's exceptionally skilled at locating tension and coaxing it away until your body has become putty under her hands.\n\nFor a more energizing experience, check out one of her daily yoga classes, which include several moments of silent meditation -- perfect for helping to unlock those creative juices.\n\nFruits of Quy Nhon\n\nGuests can opt for in-room dining or head to the city center for a meal in a local restaurant. Quy Nhon Anantara Villas\n\nQuy Nhon locals shilling eel and morning glory at the daily market, selling whole coconuts for coconut water (for about 7 VND) on the road and whipping up egg coffee at the cafes in town are all part of what makes a visit to this hidden part of Vietnam so special.\n\nAs with any city or town, there's no shortage of ways to experience the wide-ranging, fresh flavors of Quy Nhon. If you've gotten comfortable motorbiking on the winding mountainous roads leading into the town's center, you'll want to go in search of Vietnamese pancakes or crepes (Bánh xèo) stuffed with shrimp, pork and a bounty of fresh herbs.\n\nFor a deeper dive -- and taste -- of the culture, opt for Anantara's Night Market experience. Bonus: If you plan to drink, it's a good idea to have a designated driver, especially if you like karaoke.\n\nBao, a regular tour guide who can only be booked through the Anantara, knows his way around town and can point out the best spot for the popular pastime. If singing isn't your thing, stroll along the city's ocean-facing promenade and check out the giant Ho Chi Minh statue.\n\nWhen you're ready to get off your feet, head to the bar on the beach for a nightcap. There's imported beer on offer at Quy Nhon's main beach bar -- Surf Bar 2 -- if you're tired of the ubiquitous Saigon or Hanoi beer options, but you'll have to go back to the villa for anything resembling craft beer.\n\nRelated content 30 of Vietnam's most beautiful places\n\nAnother Quy Nhon specialty is oysters.\n\nAt Sea.Fire.Salt. , Anantara's on-site restaurant, Chef Mr. Marcus Meek serves the plump, juicy bivalves naked or with a variety of condiments including lemon, cocktail sauce, black bean sauce and mignonette. Pair the starter course with Champagne or a Heart of Darkness IPA before moving on to another of Chef Meek's local specialties.\n\nThe British-born chef is excited about the menu he's created -- formerly heavily American and now decidedly more Vietnamese, thanks to early guest feedback -- and is particularly enthusiastic about another of the property's programs: Private beachfront dining celebrations.\n\nThe 5-star Anantara, a 26-villa, full-service resort, is a recent addition to Quy Nhon.

They represent 0.00010% of the 1.8 million apps available through the mobile App Store, the company said.\n\nThe company said it had been moving in this direction for months. In June, Apple prohibited the promotion of vaping products in its app store and had not approved any new vaping-related apps since.\n\nThe apps now banned from the App Store will continue to work for customers who already have them downloaded on their devices, and they can be transferred to new devices.\n\nApple's move was applauded by groups such as the American Heart Association and the ghd Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\n\"By taking e-cigarette related apps off the App Store, Apple will help reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette marketing and discourage youth use of these products.

After managing a museum in Austria in the 1990s, he says he turned his attention to Bangkok's nightlife, investing in entertainment venues including some in Patpong.\n\nFrom banana plantation to red light zone\n\nPatpong Road's origins date back to a Chinese immigrant, Luang Patpongpanich, who purchased the land when it was a banana plantation.\n\nThe museum displays two heavy rice bags connected by a bamboo pole for visitors to lift, a way to experience the burden felt by laborers shouldering 35-kilogram loads.\n\nDuring World War II, Patpongpanich's son Udom reportedly studied in America, where he joined Washington's newly created Office of Strategic Services (OSS) which eventually morphed into the CIA.\n\nThe OSS trained Udom to be a Seri Thai (\"Free Thai\") insurgent against Japan's occupation of Thailand, according to museum information, which is supported by a three-page story in Asia Magazine dated May 5, 1985 which includes an interview with Udom, and also in a 1996 obituary in London's Guardian newspaper.\n\nBut the war ended before he returned home.\n\nRelated content 10 alternative Thai islands for those who hate crowds\n\nAfter Udom arrived in Bangkok, he transformed his family's land into Patpong Road and lined it with shop houses, which he rented to his OSS and CIA friends, Messner says.\n\n\"Mizu's Kitchen is the first food and beverage place in Patpong, run by a Japanese ex-soldier who was part of the occupational force but he liked it here so much that he wanted to stay,\" he reveals.\n\n\"The Foreign Correspondents' Club's first office or first meeting place was actually at Mizu's Kitchen. It just closed its doors this year, about three months ago, and we rescued the signage outside,\" Messner adds, gesturing at its weather-beaten sign.\n\nOther Patpong tenants during those years, according to museum exhibits, included the US Information Service library and \"a CIA safe house\" above the Madrid Bar where, in later years, retired CIA officials reportedly drank and met buddies.\n\nAlongside these bits of info, the museum displays photos of late CIA officer Jack Shirley taken in the Madrid Bar, which is still open.\n\n\"Tenants also included IBM, Shell, and CAT -- Civil Air Transport -- a company owned 100% by the CIA,\" says Messner. \"It's an airline that did covert operations throughout Asia from 1950 to 1959.\"\n\nCAT became precursor to the CIA's proprietary Air America, known as \" the world's most shot-at airline ,\" especially in Laos while transporting troops, casualties, refugees, ammunition, rice and other supplies -- all part of the US covert war against communism.\n\nExhibitions include this piece of anti-communist propaganda produced by the Thai government during the 1970s.

Richard S. Ehrlich\n\nInside the museum, a corner is dedicated to a man who's widely considered to be the world's most macabre CIA paramilitary officer, Tony Poshepny -- \"one of the most famous and controversial characters that have visited Patpong often,\" says Messner.\n\nAccording to the museum's timeline of Patpong history , he joined SEA Supply, a CIA front company operating out of Patpong, in 1958. But he \"visited the Civil Air Transport (CAT) offices in building number 1 on Patpong Road as early as 1953 and was a frequent visitor throughout the years until his departure to the United States in the 1990s,\" Messner says.\n\nPopularly known as Tony Poe, he was based in northern Laos for several years, beginning in the early 1960s, and reportedly led thousands of minority ethnic Hmong in bloody, scattered fighting against communist Pathet Lao forces and their North Vietnamese allies.\n\nRelated content Striking photographs show abandoned Cold War sites across the world\n\nTo confirm that his Hmong rebels were killing Pathet Lao, Poe ordered them to start \"cutting off people's ears and heads,\" says Messner.\n\nWhen the American Embassy in Laos criticized Poe for his violent methods, he took some hacked-off ears, \"put them in a bag, and sent that\" to then-Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley, shocking the diplomat and his staff.\n\nPoe also took \"cut-off heads and threw them out of helicopters at least on two occasions\" at high-ranking Pathet Lao, Messner says.\n\nAs shocking as these allegations are, Poe himself confirmed these well-known acts to this reporter during an interview in San Francisco in 2001 and others before he died in 2003\n\nIt was \"psychological warfare,\" says Messner, pointing to photos, weapons and other items symbolizing America's war in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\n\"This is five ears, human ears, cut off and assembled on a chain so you could wear it on a necklace or something,\" he notes, referring to a nearby display featuring fake rubber ears -- an artistic interpretation of Poe's order to his Hmong fighters to cut off ears.\n\nPoe didn't create such a necklace or wear one but, Messner says, the \"cut-off ears are a fact established by many first hand sources, and became part of the myth around Poe. We take the liberty to communicate that visually in a way that is impactful to the viewer.\"\n\nPatpong's seedy side\n\nA Patpong Museum would not be complete without exhibitions documenting the road's most famous attractions.\n\nThe museum recreates a slice of Patpong's former Grand Prix bar, including a 3-D projection of a bikini-clad go-go dancer.\n\nElsewhere a woman's silhouette has, between her thighs, an industrial-strength ping-pong training machine, which pumps white balls at viewers to catch.\n\n\"Here on Patpong, everybody wants to see the ping-pong show,\" says Messner.\n\nRelated content Best party cities around the world\n\nInstead of portraying a live woman, who doesn't use a machine, the museum constructed this \"interactive\" display.\n\nOther displays that may make some visitors uncomfortable include a video featuring a bar worker preparing to perform with a live goldfish during a 2013 bestiality show.\n\nMeanwhile, Oculus Virtual Reality goggles allow people to explore Patpong's current S&M fetish bar.\n\nElsewhere, a wall-mounted \"game\" invites visitors to look at photos of Thai women and guess if they were born female.\n\nBut the museum and its exhibits aren't impressing everyone -- a near certainty given the subject matter.\n\nBangkok-based journalist Tom Vater is among those expressing mixed feelings about the space.\n\n\"The US killed some four million people during its wars in Southeast Asia when Patpong was in full bloom,\" says Vater, co-writer of the documentary film, \"The Most Secret Place on Earth: America's Covert War in Laos.\"\n\nRelated content 7 best temples to visit in Bangkok\n\n\"I went [to Patpong] several times during the film's research, particularly to the Crown Royal Bar and the Madrid Bar to talk to ex-CIA, USAID and Air America staff,\" he says.\n\n\"Most of the former soldiers, pilots, secret service staff and mercenaries I met were polite, helpful and very open about their wartime experiences. The men who frequented the bars in Patpong were, as often as not, murderers engaged in crimes against humanity. That should give pause for thought about what kind of museum might be established here.\"\n\nToday's Patpong: More shopping than sleaze\n\nEvery night, outdoor stalls fill Patpong Road. Richard S.

{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/14/health/astronaut-countermeasures-cancer-patients-scn/index.html", "title": "Astronaut exercise programs may help cancer patients, researchers say", "content": "(CNN) The rigors and challenges of spaceflight are remarkably similar to the physical stress cancer patients experiment during chemotherapy and other treatments, according to researchers.\n\nFor that reason, the researchers suggest that the countermeasures program used by astronauts before, during and after spaceflight to maintain their health could be developed and applied for cancer patients to help them recover after treatment.\n\nThe details were published in a commentary written by researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and NASA on Thursday in the journal Cell . The work was supported by the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"It was surprising when we looked at similarities between astronauts during spaceflight and cancer patients during treatment. Both have a decrease in muscle mass, and they have bone demineralization and changes in heart function,\" said Jessica Scott, senior author and an exercise physiology researcher at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Exercise Oncology Service. \"Astronauts may get something called space fog, where they have trouble focusing or get a little forgetful. That's very similar to what some cancer patients experience, which is called chemo brain.\"\n\nBut astronauts and cancer patients are advised in a completely different way from each other, despite the similar issues they face. The authors of the commentary looked at the countermeasures program created by NASA to see how it might be applied to cancer patients.\n\nFor 58 years, NASA has been sending humans into space, with flights ranging from 15 minutes in duration in 1961 to nearly a year on the International Space Station for current astronauts.\n\nThe quest for countermeasures to help humans remain stable and healthy in space began early. They didn't know what effect zero gravity might have on the body or specific organs. And they were mainly concerned with cardiac injury, so multiple assessments were used to monitor that activity before, during and after flight, according to the commentary.\n\nNASA's concerns were valid. Apollo astronaut James Irwin had an undetected coronary heart disease and 21 months after returning to Earth, he suffered an acute myocardial infarction, the authors wrote.\n\nInitially, the Project Mercury astronauts, announced in 1959, had to run each day for a month before their spaceflight. Gemini astronauts exercised before their missions and during spaceflight as well, using bungee cords. By the time space station missions began in 2001, NASA had astronauts performing a combination of aerobic exercise and strength training during their 91- to 215-day missions.\n\nNASA astronaut Sunita Williams, seen here on the station in 2012, conducs an experiment to measure oxygen uptake and cardiac output.\n\nNow, in the months prior to their launch, astronauts work with specialists to create a strength, condition and rehab program to create a baseline before flight. They continue the program using equipment on the station. When they return, the astronauts are monitored as they exercise to be sure that their fitness returns to the baseline level established before spaceflight.\n\nAfter more than 50 years of human spaceflight, researchers know some of the risks posed to the human body by being in zero gravity. Astronauts have to deal with a stressful environment, noise, isolation, disrupted circadian rhythm, radiation exposure and a headward fluid shift that happens when floating as opposed standing on solid ground.\n\nOver time, astronauts staying for six months or more on the station can experience the weakening and loss of bone and muscle atrophy. Astronauts also experience blood volume loss, weakened immune systems and cardiovascular deconditioning since floating takes little effort and the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood, according to NASA's Human Research Program.\n\nNASA astronaut Reid Wiseman works out on th ISS during Expedition 40.\n\nThe countermeasures were developed to mitigate these risks. But as the authors of the commentary point out, \"Cancer is the only major chronic disease condition in which a comparable countermeasures program is not an aspect of standard management.\"\n\nIn contrast with astronauts who are asked to exercise and monitor the levels of their cardiorespiratory fitness, cancer patients are advised differently.\n\n\"That's completely backwards to how it is on Earth, where cancer patients may still be advised to rest in preparation for and during treatment and may have to ask permission to exercise from their physicians,\" Scott said.\n\nWhile NASA was studying how to keep astronauts healthy and safe in the 1960s, doctors were striving to discover new cancer treatments, the authors wrote. Only 50% of cancer patients survived five years beyond diagnosis. Doctors were trying to manage tumors, reducing their size and the way they spread.\n\nNow, 90% of patients survive early-stage cancer, the researchers said, but there are no current investigations into countermeasures to help the stresses and toxicity their bodies face during treatment.\n\nCurrently, managing toxicity falls to pharmaceuticals that target the function of individual organs. That doesn't help patients recover to their normal levels before being diagnosed.\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Exercise Physiologist Dan Townend conducts a cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness on Catherine Lee.\n\n\"That's why it's very timely that we start thinking about how to utilize NASA's tactics to manage some of these long-term side effects of cancer treatments,\" Scott said. \"Many patients aren't dying from their cancer, but they're now at risk of dying from these side effects. Using NASA's exercise plan could help with this.\"\n\nThe researchers suggest that even walking on a treadmill could help cancer patients, as well as tests to monitor their fitness over time to develop a baseline level and reduce the risk of heart problems that may occur as side effects from treatment. Scott's team at Sloan Kettering is currently investigating how exercise may offset these treatment side effects.\n\nThey have provided the patients with treadmills in their homes, as well as video call capability, to help them exercise before, during and after treatment.\n\nIn the commentary, the researchers suggest \"proof of concept\" randomized trials to test if a countermeasures program would work in an individualized way that begins when patients are diagnosed and follow the patients throughout the process with the goal of helping them maintain as much of a baseline as possible. Wearable devices like smartwatches make it possible for patients to be accountable and be in the privacy of their own home.\n\n\"A tremendous opportunity exists to leverage 60 years of space medicine to establish a program of research that optimizes preparation for, tolerability of, and recovery from a cancer diagnosis and treatment,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe researchers said that in order for the countermeasures program to be viable, it will need to be cost-effective and provide the desired outcomes and benefits. But if it works, it could \"change the landscape of cancer care and management.\"\n\n\"We really need to do a lot more research and a lot more work,\" Scott said. \"But it's very promising that this NASA exercise framework could be applied to help the approximately 1 million individuals that will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States this year, as well as the over 15 million cancer survivors in the United States today.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2019-11-14 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114095405-01-astronaut-training-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170512053130-astronaut-peggy-whitson-spacewalk-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114095921-03-astronaut-training-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170331104342-astronaut-space-walk-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150825105557-spacescience-logo-large-169.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190529123117-after-the-moon-mars-1-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170208164636-my-hero-sanjay-gupta-kelly-twins-00014004-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141111162617-mercury-7-nasa-story-top.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111122164309-international-space-station-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-full-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016095307-09-international-space-station-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114095740-02-astronaut-training-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160408121350-way-up-there-rachel-running-on-treadmill-exlarge-169.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Astronaut exercise programs may help cancer patients", "researchers say - CNN"], "tags": "health"}

But it never really went away .\n\nBut there are almost certainly more than four cases in the world.\n\nAnywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 people get the plague every year, the World Health Organization reported . But that total is likely too modest an estimate, since it doesn't account for unreported cases.\n\nEven by US standards, four cases is unusually low. An average of seven Americans get the plague every year , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.\n\nWhere is the plague most common?\n\nThe plague is an endemic disease (meaning it exists permanently) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. A 2017 outbreak in Madagascar infected nearly 2,350 people and killed more than 200, WHO reported, though no major outbreaks have been reported since.\n\nIn the US, cases are clustered in rural areas in southwest states, like Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado (where plague-carrying prairie dogs canceled camping at a Phish festival outside Denver earlier this year).\n\nHow likely am I to become infected?\n\nThe plague is still relatively uncommon, though your risk of contracting it might be higher depending on where you live.\n\nThere's a risk of human plague wherever humans and animals that contain the plague bacteria co-exist, WHO said.\n\nAccording to a 2016 map , the possibility of plague exists on almost every continent, especially the western US, parts of Brazil, scattered areas in southeast Africa and large swaths of China, India and the Middle East.\n\nBut unless you live among a great deal of wild, disease-carrying rodents, your odds of infection in the US are slim.\n\nHow do you get the plague?\n\nThat depends on the type. Bubonic plague, the more common form, is caused by bites from infected fleas. It's rarely transmitted between humans.\n\nIt's also possible to transmit by handling an infected animal's tissue, as in the case of the Mongolian couple.\n\nPneumonic plague is the more severe and highly contagious type. Any person infected with pneumonic plague, which originates in the lungs, can infect another person if they inhale droplets from a cough or sneeze.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nEvery form of the plague starts out similarly -- fever, chills, weakness, headache -- before diverging, according to the CDC.\n\nBubonic plague manifests as painfully swollen lymph nodes, called \"buboes,\" which can open into pus-filled sores in advanced cases.\n\nPneumonic plague, since it originates in the lungs, can cause shortness of breath, chest pain and occasionally bloody mucous. It can eventually cause respiratory failure and shock, too.\n\nAnother form, septicemic plague, can kill skin and tissue, turning it black, particularly on fingers, toes and the nose.\n\nCan I prevent the plague?\n\nThere's no commercial plague vaccine, the CDC said, but it can be treated with antibiotics.

I guess none of us are.\"\n\nAs lung damage increases, a gradual onset of COPD can often go unnoticed for years. By the time she visited a doctor, Dorney Koppel, a lawyer, was struggling to breathe every day and couldn't manage to walk more than a few dozen yards.\n\nTests showed the former smoker had lost 75% of her lung function. She needed to use a wheelchair, because even walking a short distance had become impossible.\n\nWhat is COPD?\n\nCOPD is America's third most fatal chronic disease, with a five-year survival rate of 40% to 70%.\n\nThe two most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and those with the disease have airways that are partially blocked, according to Medline . Initial symptoms can include cough, sputum production and shortness of breath, especially on exertion, which limits their activity.\n\nAnd the disease affects populations well beyond smokers.\n\nIt's common among construction workers as well as firefighters and first responders, and rampant among those who lived in lower Manhattan during and after the World Trade Center terror attack.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also tracked increased COPD prevalence among office workers, stemming from paper dust and fumes from photocopiers, chemicals, and oil-based ink.\n\nTed Koppel hosted ABC's \"Nightline\" from 1980 to 2005.\n\nSixteen million Americans are currently diagnosed with the disease and COPD is expected to cost the country $49 billion in 2020, according to the National Institutes of Health , though millions more are thought to be undiagnosed. Each year it kills 155,000 people.\n\n\"That is more than all the Americans who died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan put together,\" said Ted Koppel, who covered multiple wars as a correspondent and anchor.\n\nSince 1969, the death rate for COPD has doubled, even as the number of deaths for other chronic diseases has fallen.\n\nPatients are concentrated in rural areas, with states such as West Virginia having some of the highest prevalence rates.\n\n\"These people are isolated by economics. They're isolated geographically,\" Koppel said. \"And they're isolated because this is a disease that makes people ashamed if they got it through something like smoking.\"\n\nEarlier studies have shown that four in 10 Americans live in areas with air that has unhealthy levels of particulate pollution or ozone. And as the A study published this year in the European Respiratory Journal showed that air pollution can age the lungs, increasing the risk for COPD.Earlier studies have shown that four in 10 Americans live in areas with air that has unhealthy levels of particulate pollution or ozone. And as the climate crisis makes air quality worse, rates of COPD are expected to climb.\n\nIn short, anyone with lungs is susceptible.\n\nThey've been fighting COPD for decades\n\nA decade and a half beyond the life span her doctor gave her in 2001, Dorney Koppel credits pulmonary rehabilitation for her vitality, and has spent much of her life trying to help others find that same breath of life.\n\nPulmonary rehab is the standard care for COPD patients and includes directed exercise as well as nutrition guidance and support for those with lung diseases. But only 3.7% of Medicare-eligible COPD patients undergo the rehab, due in part to a 2010 rule change in Medicare's reimbursement policies. That change likely led to a similar procedure, cardiac rehab, being eligible for double the federal reimbursement rate of pulmonary rehab, the California Society for Pulmonary Rehabilitation says.\n\nDorney Koppel doesn't shake people's hands, preferring to greet new faces with an elbow bump, to avoid catching germs. \"Every cold, every flu, could be fatal,\" she said.\n\nHer husband, who hosted ABC's \"Nightline\" for 25 years, has been playing a supportive role, speaking up about the disease with the same baritone voice that delivered the news to millions of Americans every night for decades.\n\nThe couple met at Stanford in the early 1960s, where they both earned master's degrees.\n\nBefore long, Koppel was covering the civil rights movement in Selma, Alabama, in 1964, and later they moved their young family to Hong Kong, when he became an ABC correspondent covering Vietnam.\n\nIn the 1970s, and now living back stateside, Koppel took a year off from his job as an anchor to stay at home with the couple's children while Dorney Koppel finished her law degree at Georgetown University Law Center. After she graduated, she practiced law, focusing on criminal and civil litigation.\n\nTed Koppel, second from right, and his wife Grace Anne Dorney Koppel, right, attend a celebration for Koppel's 42-year career with ABC News on November 22, 2005.\n\nNow she has a new role: spokeswoman. In her fight against COPD, Dorney Koppel says one of her greatest weapons is that she's \"married to a celebrity.\" Beginning in 2006, Dorney Koppel became the national spokeswoman and patient advocate for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\n\"I'm an attorney. I'm a behavioral scientist. I'm a wife and mother. Why should I do this?\" Dorney Koppel asked. \"I made the decision: I'll give up my privacy because there are so many people [with COPD] out there. I hope I can empower them to come forward.\"\n\nShe and her husband cofounded 12 pulmonary rehabilitation centers across five states, focusing on placing them in rural communities, where COPD is more common. The clinics are funded in part through the Dorney Koppel Family Charitable Foundation.\n\nIn addition to the clinics and being a spokeswoman for the condition, Dorney Koppel became the president of the national COPD Foundation in 2016.\n\nKoppel, who in his post-\"Nightline\" career now serves as a senior CBS \"Sunday Morning\" contributor, has fronted several recent news stories for the network about COPD.\n\nThrough running their clinics, they've come up against a core issue that's hamstrung progress against COPD: It's hard for hospitals to make money off pulmonary rehab.\n\nA major COPD solution is hard to fund\n\nIf there's a consensus that pulmonary rehab is the best treatment, why isn't it available everywhere?\n\n\"My theory on it is the typical journalist thing. Follow the money,\" Koppel said.\n\n\"Where there are diseases with treatments that can create huge earning capabilities -- whether it be for medical professionals or the pharmaceutical industry -- you're going to see a lot of money being spent on those diseases,\" he said.\n\nBut Medicare only reimburses pulmonary rehab at 50% of the rate of cardiac rehab, according to the California Society for Pulmonary Rehabilitation\n\nThat's a key stumbling point in making pulmonary rehab available to a wider part of the US population.\n\nAnd it's hurting the Koppels' own efforts to keep running their rural rehab clinics. A couple of clinics may not be financially sustainable, Koppel said.\n\nA brainstorming session at Stanford\n\nIn September, the Koppels returned to their alma mater for the Stanford Medicine X conference, an annual gathering of innovative health minds.\n\nThey virtually took over the conference with a \"Grand Design Challenge\" focused on COPD and teamed up with the IDEO design firm that worked with Apple to create the first computer mouse\n\nKoppel says IDEO had stuck in his head for years because \"Nightline\" got more requests for recordings of its 1999 episode about building a better shopping cart with IDEO than any other in the show's history.\n\nTurning loose young, innovative minds on COPD generated some leads, Koppel said.\n\nFor instance, at the end of the two-day challenge, one group presented a scheme in which COPD doctors and therapists might create a national certification program by which gyms such as LA Fitness or Gold's Gym might offer COPD-related pulmonary therapy services, at a time when rural hospitals are increasingly closing.\n\nTed Koppel and Grace Anne Dorney Koppel, left, onstage at the Stanford Medicine X Conference.\n\nAnother outside-the-box idea to scale pulmonary therapy nationally was to add the services at Walmart, similar to the optometry centers the retailer already operates in its stores.\n\nmore prevalent. Dorney Koppel said the COPD Foundation had once had a similar partnership, Another group suggested a partnership with NASCAR, a sport popular in rural states where COPD cases aremore prevalent.Dorney Koppel said the COPD Foundation had once had a similar partnership, Drive4COPD , and it could be worth exploring again.\n\n\"This kind of creative approach may be a way of opening doors that have been closed,\" Dorney Koppel said.\n\nHer personal struggle still helps fuel the fight\n\nDorney Koppel's frequent personal symptoms keep her focused on the importance of helping the broader COPD patient population.\n\nEven 18 years later, after years of pulmonary rehab, she still feels periodic crippling attacks due to COPD.\n\n\"Tears roll down my face. I struggle for breath,\" she said. \"Each breath feels like it can be the last breath.\"\n\nA few weeks ago she had one of those attacks. \"I suddenly started having chills. I couldn't breathe at all,\" she said.\n\nShe says she's lucky she has a partner by her side.\n\n\"Ted was able to get my portable oxygen concentrator,\" she said.\n\nShe got a breath of fresh air, and more than a decade after what she's called her \"use by\" date, she's still going strong in her campaign to help the world breathe a little better.", "authors": ["Ryan Prior"], "publish_date": "2019-11-15 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191102184258-02-ted-and-grace-anne-koppel-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002161903-ted-and-grace-anne-koppel-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002161903-ted-and-grace-anne-koppel-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002161230-ted-koppel-nightline-restricted-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191102192952-04-ted-and-grace-anne-koppel-restricted-large-169.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Ted Koppel and his wife have dedicated themselves to fighting COPD - CNN"], "tags": "health"}

The county saw acute complications with multiple hospitalizations, including care for pneumonia and preterm births.\n\n\"Since October, nearly 30,000 measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations have been administered in Rockland County, which represents three times more than our annual baseline,\" Ruppert said.\n\nAlong with the New York State Health Department and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, county health officials actively monitored 1,195 people who had or were exposed to measles. People with measles or who were exposed were voluntarily quarantined.\n\n\"That number is staggering, and it shows just how hard we've worked over the last year,\" said Rockland County Executive Ed Day.\n\nAs summer camp season approached, it was important to the county that children be able to attend, Ruppert said. Health officials reviewed 18,791 immunization records of both staff and campers, so all camps in Rockland County received their permits and opened on time. Two MMR vaccines were required for campers and camp staff.\n\n\"I want to sincerely thank our community partners, including our local hospitals, urgent care facilities, health centers and primary care providers,\" Ruppert said. \"This was a true team effort.\"\n\nChallenges to overcoming the outbreak\n\nReasons for the outbreak include people who refuse to vaccinate, anti-vaxxers and, largely, parents who \"create their own immunization schedules by delaying vaccinations\" -- all of which leave children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable disease, according to Ruppert.\n\nThe outbreaks in Rockland County were largely among children in the Orthodox Jewish communities whose parents refused to vaccinate them. Living in clusters, which is common in the Orthodox Jewish community in New York, helps encourage measles to spread.\n\nOf the confirmed and reported measles cases as of August 26, 91% of the people infected had either not received the MMR vaccine or had no record of receiving one. Two doses of MMR are 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC\n\nThe state was having trouble communicating effectively with its Orthodox Jewish community about the dangers of the measles outbreak. The New York State Health Department spent tens of thousands of dollars creating and distributing measles information sheets in Yiddish to hang on the doors of more than 45,000 homes in those communities.\n\nBut the Yiddish was mangled. The effort to present important measles information to this community in different ways, such as through WhatsApp and news phone lines, came six months after the outbreak.\n\nIt wasn't until June that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation that removed nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements.\n\nAnother challenge to the measles crisis was anti-vaxxers who specifically targeted the Orthodox Jewish community, spreading claims that vaccines caused conditions such as autism and sudden infant death syndrome.\n\n\"Vaccines have been thoroughly tested and are safe, effective and lifesaving,\" Ruppert said. \"To prevent possible future outbreaks, it's essential that all children who will receive vaccinations receive them on time.\"\n\nRockland County health officials urged that in addition to vaccination, people should heed the CDC's plan for travel to ensure protection against measles, which means knowing which countries are having measles outbreaks and the symptoms to watch for.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on this planet,\" Day said. \"That has driven every decision during this outbreak, and despite setbacks, this outbreak has shown what we can accomplish with local, state and even federal levels of government when we work together.\"", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2019-09-25 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190613115158-mumps-measles-vaccine-file-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190621105138-flu-shot-file-super-tease.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190129095541-01-measles-vaccine-file-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190509124324-vaccine-shot-0429-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190129095541-01-measles-vaccine-file-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190715162415-cnnee-measles-large-169.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Measles outbreak that sickened 312 in Rockland County", "New York", "declared over  - CNN"], "tags": "health"}

A second presentation says that young people who use weed frequently are at a higher risk for stroke.\n\nThe first presentation found that a young person diagnosed with a cannabis use disorder had a 47% to 52% greater risk of being hospitalized for an arrhythmia , or irregular heartbeat, if they regularly used weed.\n\nHeart rhythm problems occur when the electrical impulses that make your heart beat in time don't work quite right -- making your heart beat too fast or too slow, or irregularly. This isn't just a disconcerting feeling; it can be deadly. A problem with the heart's rhythm can also lead to a stroke or heart failure.\n\nIn the presentation, scientists noticed the connection between weed and heart problems by looking at data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample , the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient health care database in the US that gives national estimates of hospital stays.\n\nIn that data, 2.6% of patients hospitalized for a heart arrhythmia were regular cannabis users. These patients tended to be younger, between the ages of 15 and 24, male and black.\n\nAdjusting for other factors, 15- to 24-year-old weed users had 1.28 times higher odds of having to go to the hospital for this heart problem and 25- to 34-year-olds faced 1.52 times higher odds.\n\n\"The effects of using cannabis are seen within 15 minutes and last for around three hours. At lower doses, it is linked to a rapid heartbeat. At higher doses, it is linked to a too-slow heartbeat,\" Dr. Rikinkumar S. Patel, resident physician in the department of psychiatry at the Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman, Oklahoma, said in a press release.\n\n\"The risk of cannabis use linked to arrhythmia in young people is a major concern, and physicians should ask patients hospitalized with arrhythmias about their use of cannabis and other substances because they could be triggering their arrhythmias.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the other presentation, researchers noted that young people who use cannabis more than 10 days a month were nearly 2.5 times more likely to have a stroke, compared to people who didn't use the drug. For those who frequently used cannabis and also also smoked cigarettes or used e-cigarettes, the risk was even higher. They were three times more likely to have a stroke, compared to people who did not smoke or use e-cigarettes and weed.\n\nFor that study, researchers looked at data from 43,000 adults who were a part of the behavioral risk factor surveillance system between 2016 and 2017. The participants were between the age of 18 to 44, and 14% said they had used cannabis in the last 30 days. Those who said they used the drug were typically younger, male, and Hispanic or African American.\n\nThis was an observational study and did not look at what might cause the increased risk. But authors hope doctors will take the information into account when they talk to their patients.\n\n\"Physicians should ask patients if they use cannabis and counsel them about its potential stroke risk as part of regular doctor visits,\" co-author Tarang Parekh, a health policy research at George Mason University, said in a statement.\n\nThis research is consistent with some other studies and builds on what scientists already know about the way in which cannabinoids interact with the heart. Earlier research has shown that using cannabinoids can raise a person's resting heart rate and dilate their blood vessels, making the heart pump much harder. It's also known that the risk of a heart attack is much higher in the hour after someone smokes weed, if the person already has an underlying heart condition. In some studies, cannabis use has been found to be associated with stroke and myocardial infarction.\n\nWith the legalization of weed in several states, researchers said they hope more scientists will look into any potential health risks as the use of the drug becomes more acceptable.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2019-11-11 00:00:00", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190927094144-weed-5-cbd-craze-sanjay-gupta-cnn-special-report-00001924-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180330162017-02-medical-cannabis-law-opioid-prescriptions-study-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140310200119-orig-jr-brain-on-weed-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Using weed regularly raises the risk of heart problems for young people", "studies find - CNN"], "tags": "health"}

It is even more important in our modern environment, filled with labor-saving devices, televisions and technology.\n\nA 2003 study found that the impact of mechanization and labor-saving devices, including dishwashers, washing machines, escalators and cars utilized in driving to work, led to a 111-calorie reduction in daily energy expenditure. Unless this reduction is offset by increased activity, it could lead to significant weight gain over time.\n\nThey eat spicy food.\n\nIf you pay closer attention, you may notice that your naturally slim friends are the ones dousing their meals with extra-spicy hot sauce or eating hot chili peppers regularly. This may not be a coincidence. Observational data show that eating spicier foods is associated with less obesity.\n\nA recent review article summarizes the growing body of research showing that capsaicin, a major bioactive compound present in chili peppers, may play a role in weight control in several ways, including reducing appetite, activating heat-generating and calorie-burning brown fat, increasing the use of fat as fuel and modestly increasing metabolism.\n\nIn addition, spicy food seems to keep people healthier. A very large Chinese study found that those who ate spicy food six to seven times per week versus once or less per week were 14% less likely to die from any cause\n\nNumerous other spices including cumin, ginger, rosemary, oregano, cinnamon and turmeric may also play a role in helping you stay slim by reducing inflammation, improving your body's response to insulin and improving the composition of bacteria in your gut. (I should disclose that I wrote about weight and health benefits of spices, including spice-filled recipes, in my new book, \" Spice Up, Slim Down \").\n\nThey live at a higher elevation.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Colorado has the lowest rate of obesity in the United States, and there may be a good reason why: the altitude.\n\nA 2013 article in the International Journal of Obesity found lower obesity rates in those living at higher elevations.\n\nColorado has the lowest rate of obesity in the United States.\n\nBoth men and women living at less than 500 meters (1,640 feet) above sea level had a 5.1 and 3.9 times, respectively, higher odds of being obese compared with their counterparts living at 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) or greater above sea level, after controlling for demographics and lifestyle.\n\nThose living at 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) had more modest, but still significant, 7.5% lower odds of being obese. The study's authors suggest that lower oxygen levels, higher metabolic demands at higher altitudes and increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system (which may reduce appetite) are all possible causes of this finding, but a definitive explanation has yet to be fully established.\n\nThey live in a big city.\n\nThe study that looked at elevation and weight also found that people who lived in big cities, defined as metro counties with a population of 1 million or greater, had a significantly lower risk of obesity compared with those living in smaller metro, non-metro or rural counties.\n\nThe authors suggest that food security, increased walkability of larger metro areas and better diet may explain these findings.\n\nBut their conclusions are contradicted by other studies that have shown urbanization may lead to obesity , especially in children and low-income populations.\n\nAccording to the Harvard School for Public Health, this is probably due to increased access to high-calorie foods (especially fast food), more passive transportation (less walking), less open space, more mass media marketing of unhealthy foods and less work-related physical activity.\n\nBut even if you don't fall into those categories ...\n\nI don't expect you to move to the mountains of Nepal to stay slim, but spicing up your diet and making an effort to move more on a daily basis could certainly help.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd if you don't live in a big city or near an exercise facility, a healthy lifestyle -- including daily exercise, less sedentary behavior, better sleep and a healthful diet -- will help keep you lean, regardless of your environment.", "authors": ["Dr. Melina Jampolis"], "publish_date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819172918-girls-dancing-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131122232657-sex-couple-feet-bed-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819174835-restricted-karaoke-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819172920-farmers-market-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819172918-girls-dancing-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120301012839-red-chilies-story-top.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151106072005-denver-skyline-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150820141753-standing-desk-stock-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819181257-cold-weather-file-photo-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150820141751-cooking-stock-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819181259-restricted-cleaning-kitchen-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819172917-laughing-face-small-11.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819174835-restricted-karaoke-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150820141753-standing-desk-stock-small-11.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130607090747-computer-user-file-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819172920-farmers-market-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819181259-restricted-cleaning-kitchen-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821133530-rubiks-cube-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170221134719-01-hidden-medical-causes-of-weight-gain-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131122232657-sex-couple-feet-bed-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120705142059-woman-mountain-nature-walk-independence-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819181257-cold-weather-file-photo-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171113071720-07-happiest-cities-blue-zones-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819172917-laughing-face-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150820141751-cooking-stock-super-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821133530-rubiks-cube-super-169.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Surprising factors that may keep you thin  - CNN"], "tags": "health"}
{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/health/intersex-child-parenting-eprise/index.html", "title": "Raising an intersex child: 'This is your body. ... There's nothing to be ashamed of'", "content": "(CNN) When Stephani Lohman got her first look at her newborn in the delivery room, she playfully hit her husband, Eric, on the arm. She made a flustered comment about how ultrasounds could get the sex of the child wrong.\n\nThe doctors in the Ontario hospital were silent. Eric knew that the situation was more serious than a mixup.\n\n\"I sort of looked around at that moment, and I saw what I would describe as panic on all of the medical staff's faces,\" Eric said.\n\nThey had expected their baby, Rosie, to be a girl, but her parents saw what seemed to be a penis. Eric remembered learning when he was getting his doctorate about babies born with genitalia that wasn't typically male or female. He realized right away that Rosie was like those babies.\n\n\"I wanted the baby to be put on my chest right away, because I just had her, and I worked really hard for that moment, and they didn't,\" Stephani said, recalling that day in 2012. \"And I was scared.\"\n\nThe doctors covered Rosie with a blanket and took her across the room for what seemed like a long time, Eric said. When they returned, they offered what they knew: Rosie had atypical genitalia, and more tests were needed to determine whether she was genetically a girl or a boy and if she had a serious medical condition, Eric said the doctors told them.\n\n\"It basically went from very celebratory, very exciting, to very scary,\" Eric said.\n\nEric Lohman holds Rosie in the hospital in August 2012.\n\nThe next few days were filled with extensive tests and examinations until the doctors were finally able to make a diagnosis. Rosie had two X chromosomes, and so was considered to be female, they said, but she had salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a severe form of a condition called CAH for short. People with CAH are missing an enzyme that the adrenal glands need to produce cortisol. Rosie's body is unable to retain enough sodium.\n\nThe adrenal glands also produce the initial ingredients of sex hormones, so when the brain gets signals that cortisol levels are low, it demands that the adrenal glands work harder. That leads to a higher production of sex hormone ingredients, which results in an excess of male hormones. Those hormones are what cause the formation of atypical genitalia in fetuses with two X chromosomes while they're in utero.\n\nRosie's condition is classified as a DSD, or differences or disorders of sex development, by many physicians. Some patients and parents of patients -- including Eric and Stephani -- dislike this classification. They prefer the term intersex.\n\nMany conditions under the DSD/intersex umbrella could result in a variety of different physical sex characteristics on individuals, such as an enlarged clitoris or a micropenis.\n\nAtypical genitalia does not always occur in patients with CAH, but when it does, doctors sometimes encourage plastic surgery.\n\nEric remembered learning about these operations as a student, and he was skeptical.\n\nStephani stayed in the hospital with Rosie, who was still being monitored, and began to research the surgeries. At home, Eric did the same. They familiarized themselves with the list of potential long-term risks, such as chronic pain, an inability to orgasm or eventual rejection of gender assignment. If the doctors proposed surgery, Eric wanted to say no. Stephani didn't even anticipate that it would come up.\n\n\"My idea, because I was very naive about it, was that they would never recommend anything that wasn't necessary right now,\" Stephani said. \"Like, they wouldn't put a tiny baby under the knife for no reason. Can you imagine a world in which they're just doing cosmetic surgeries on babies? I couldn't even imagine that existed.\"\n\nAn 'easy' fix\n\nThe surgical approach to CAH and other DSD/intersex conditions began in the 1960s, when doctors found ways to perform surgeries that reduced some of parents' anxieties about their babies. The surgeries were intended to help patients conform more with the mainstream characteristics of one sex or the other. But sometimes, the outcomes of these surgeries didn't align with patients' eventual gender identities.\n\nOver the years, some who had these surgeries grew to feel a misalignment between their sex and their gender, or felt that surgery had left them mutilated because their genitals lacked sexual sensation. This led to a wave of activism referred to as the intersex rights movement, with people speaking out and protesting medically unnecessary surgeries on children.\n\nToday, these surgeries are starting to be viewed more as cosmetic procedures instead of emergency treatments, but they are still performed.\n\nThere's legislative pushback from the intersex community too, most recently seen through a California bill, SB 201.\n\nThe bill would prohibit doctors from performing surgeries on minors with atypical genitalia unless the procedures are determined to be \"medically necessary\" or the child can provide informed consent beforehand. It is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco.\n\nThe California Medical Association has formally opposed the bill and wrote a letter of opposition to the state Senate Committee on Business, Professions, and Economic Development.\n\n\"The bill makes an exception for any procedure or treatment that is deemed medically necessary, which is defined in such a way that cannot properly address the complexity of DSD cases and potentially endangers the physical and emotional health and future of the patient,\" the letter stated.\n\nIn 2017, Human Rights Watch released a report on infant genital surgeries that are performed on babies with atypical genitalia, declaring it cruel and unnecessary. It provided detailed testimonials from individuals who had the surgeries and felt violated and damaged.\n\nAbout 1 in 2,000 babies is born with genitalia different enough that doctors might recommend surgery, according to the report.\n\nTiger Devore, a Las Vegas-based clinical psychologist and advocate for people considered to be sexually different, said the rate of surgeries hasn't really changed since the 1960s. A 2016 study in the Journal of Pediatric Urology found that of 37 babies with what researchers called \"moderate-to-severe genital atypia\" who were born after 2011, 35 were subject to genital surgery.\n\nDevore was born in 1958 with hypospadias, a condition in which the urinary opening is on the underside of the penis instead of the tip. He had over 25 surgeries, many of them when he was a child. He describes them as painful and unnecessary.\n\n\"There are people who have grown up having these surgeries very early on in life. They're making it very clear to the medical society that these surgeries don't work, we don't like the outcomes, this shouldn't have been done to us as children,\" Devore said. \"It's our genitalia, and we want to grow up with our own genitalia. Not the genitalia that our doctors thought was right, not the genitalia our parents thought was right. It's our body.\"\n\nSurgeries are typically performed to treat the anxiety of the parents, which is not fair to the infant, he said.\n\nThe notion is that kids will have a better life because their genitals will look normal, but often that's not the case, he said.\n\n\"If you do plastic surgery on the genitalia, you do not magically get normal male or female genitalia. We get intersex genitalia that has had plastic surgery done to it,\" he said.\n\nThe parents' decision to consent rests heavily on their education on the subject, he said.\n\n\"If they take a moment to do a little research, it can make a huge difference for the future of the child,\" he said.\n\nFeeling the pressure\n\nThree days after Rosie was born, Eric and Stephani were invited to a meeting with specialists to discuss steps. They recall walking into a room with more than a dozen medical staff: pediatric gynecologists, geneticists, pediatric urologists, endocrinologists and a social worker.\n\n\"It was probably the most intimidating room I've ever been in,\" Eric said.\n\nRosie's parents said a pediatric urologist presented them with two options only: They could reduce the size of Rosie's clitoris and create a vaginal canal, or solely do the vaginal canal surgery.\n\nHe recommended that Rosie have both procedures done simultaneously at about 6 months old, and preferably not much later than that. The argument was that the younger Rosie was, the faster she would heal, and she wouldn't have to experience looking physically different from other children.\n\nAfter thorough research, Rosie's parents knew that they didn't want either procedure.\n\nTo their dismay, not having any surgery was never presented to them as a possibility, Eric said. And when he brought it up, the doctor said that was a choice he wouldn't recommend, due to the risk that Rosie might eventually experience psychological trauma from not looking like other girls.\n\nThe rest of the staff stayed silent, Stephani said.\n\n\"It would have been nice to think that we had one ally in there, but we didn't,\" Stephani said.\n\nThe doctor's sentiment was that if Rosie looked normal, she would feel better about herself. Eric and Stephani felt there was nothing wrong with appearing different, and if there was going to be a surgery, Rosie deserved a choice in the matter. They remained adamant about not consenting to the surgeries.\n\nMeanwhile, the couple was advised by the social worker to be careful when explaining Rosie's condition to other people, including her older brother and sister.\n\nRosie at home in the summer of 2013.\n\nDavid Sandberg, a psychologist at University of Michigan who provides clinical services to children with DSD/intersex conditions and their families, said his first step when dealing with families who have a newborn with one of these conditions is to help them figure out the best way to share the information with people they trust.\n\n\"The story doesn't have to be all the details. But there should be nothing that would be considered a lie in retrospect,\" said Sandberg, who was not involved in Rosie's care. \"It could be a partial story. It could be less technical. But it has to be based in truth. Because once you go down the road of telling a non-truth, then it's very difficult to extricate yourself from that.\"\n\nThe Lohmans continued to feel pressured by their pediatric urologist to consider surgery, even as Rosie approached her first birthday. After putting their foot down and saying they wouldn't consent, the same pediatric urologist waved them away, Eric said, as if to say they would be back within a few years. (The pediatric urologist declined to comment for this story.)\n\nIt's been years since that appointment, and they still haven't returned.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, its guidelines about atypical genitalia are being reviewed.\n\n\"The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees it's important that a child's medical team and parents engage in open, transparent conversations so that parents fully understand their child's condition and the risks and benefits of any proposed treatment, as well as alternatives, such as delaying surgery,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nDr. Veronica Gomez-Lobo, director of pediatric and adolescent gynecology at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, said she agrees with the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement and the further goals it states of \"helping children to have a happy and healthy life.\"\n\nGomez-Lobo has worked with many families at the PROUD Clinic, which provides specialized diagnostic, evaluation and treatment services for children with complex diseases, including those that result in atypical genitalia. When an infant is born with one of these conditions, the first priority at the clinic is allowing parents to form a relationship with their child, she said.\n\n\"We don't even need to see these children until they've bonded with the parents, and so we don't even see them for an evaluation until about a month after they're born,\" she said.\n\nFor patients with CAH, clinic workers first make sure that all of the medical needs are being addressed and treated, Gomez-Lobo said. After that is taken care of, they inform parents of the benefits and risks of genital surgeries, and they now mention the Human Rights Watch report, she said.\n\n\"We don't know whether making a clitoris smaller has any benefit,\" she said. \"Whether that's going to make the child grow up with a better self-image or something like that, nobody has evaluated that. But there is some literature that supports that maybe doing clitoral surgery may reduce the sensation, and it depends on how it's done and a lot of different reasons.\"\n\nOut in the open\n\nAfter Rosie's diagnosis, the Lohmans spent a lot of time at home and were open about Rosie's condition only to family.\n\n\"Pretty soon, I started to feel like that was wrong,\" Stephani said.\n\nWhen they began to feel nervous about hiring babysitters who would have to change Rosie's diapers, they decided to share the secret.\n\n\"I was like, 'this is ridiculous. This is just making it shameful. Sometimes, I don't feel like we're doing her a favor,' \" Stephani said. \"We had the thought that we are contributing to this culture of shame. We're perpetuating what exactly it is we're trying to avoid.\"\n\nRosie at home in 2014.\n\nRosie was 18 months old when they stopped hiding her condition and were frank about it with friends and others outside the family, Stephani said. At age 4, Rosie was featured in the documentary \"Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric,\" now available on Netflix.\n\nThe family now lives in Milwaukee. Eric is on the board of directors of interACT, an organization dedicated to raising the visibility of intersex children and fighting for laws protecting intersex youth against surgeries.\n\nRecently, they brought Rosie to a protest at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, where they called on the facility to end the practice of medically unnecessary infant genital surgeries. In July, Eric and Stephani released a book about their experience raising an intersex child, \"Raising Rosie.\"\n\nAnd in August, Eric flew to California to testify before the state's Committee on Health in favor of a resolution that condemned unnecessary surgery on children with intersex conditions. Weeks later, the resolution passed, making California the first state to denounce such surgeries. The resolution was introduced by Wiener, who sponsored the bill that would prohibit some of these surgeries.\n\nOuting Rosie as intersex to the public has been the most troubling decision for the Lohmans, Eric said. Eric and Stephani have written a letter for Rosie to read when she is old enough, explaining how they came to the decision to speak out about her condition. They hope she'll understand. Until then, they are focused on making her as comfortable with her body as possible. As she gets older, they plan to prepare her for how to deal with addressing her condition in front of her peers and choosing when to be private.\n\n\"If the time comes and we're like, 'OK, now she's gonna have a sleepover,' we'll say, 'well, we want you to know that this is your body, and you should feel comfortable talking about it, and you don't have to show anybody your body, but there's nothing to be ashamed of,' \" Eric said.\n\nRosie's family, and their new puppy, now live in Milwaukee.\n\nThe risks of surgery on a child with differences of sexual development are well-known, the University of Michigan's Sandberg said, but the risks of avoiding surgery -- which is still rare -- are not clear. When he faces a family who wants to operate on their newborn with atypical genitalia or a family who is adamantly against it, he makes sure to warn them of the risks that could result from either decision. Because there's very little published evidence on how the children who don't have surgery do growing up, all he can do is speculate.\n\n\"Being different in some way doesn't necessarily hurt you, but it is not an advantage,\" Sandberg said. \"And so one has to know something about the factors that make a child more vulnerable for being rejected or neglected by peers. And those would be things that in a gradual, developmentally appropriate way that I would tell some families. But I would sort of telegraph that early on. If I have any value at all to the family, it's engaging them in a discussion that continues over time, as the child gets older. And then, over time, engaging the child in these conversations.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Devore, the Las Vegas clinical psychologist, said he thinks there should be only one approach toward helping parents who have a child with one of these conditions.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"We feel strongly that people who are ob-gyns and other people who deliver babies need to be taught to say, 'you have given birth to a healthy intersex child. Not just a male child. Not just a female child. Or a child that has problems. You have given birth to a healthy intersex child,' \" he said. \" 'Someday, that child may choose to have surgery or not. But the hospital will provide genetic counseling, neurologic counseling and psychological counseling so that your family can face this challenge in a healthy way and so that your child can be given the guidance to understand their difference.' \"\n\nDevore expects younger generations, as well as younger physicians, to be more open-minded about intersex conditions and variability of expression. The changing environment can be seen on college campuses, in the media and on Facebook, he said.\n\nIntersex is a viable identity that shouldn't be seen as unhealthy, he said. But it is just as important for individuals born with atypical genitalia to have the right to not be defined by that, either.\n\n\"If people have a sense of themselves as male or have a sense of themselves as female, no matter what their genitals look like, they get to identify that way,\" he said. \"And that's the most basic point that we could have emphasized. It is the right of the individual to determine how they choose to identify. It is not the right of the parent. It is not the right of the physician or surgeon.\"\n\nNothing out of the ordinary\n\nRosie is now 6 years old and has never had genital surgery. She has big green eyes and blonde hair that she prefers be kept short. Dresses are among her favorite things to wear. Her parents describe her as \"intrepid\" and \"brave.\"\n\n\"She wants a mohawk,\" Eric said. \"We try to tell her that having a mohawk is unpractical in Wisconsin because you have to wear a winter hat. But she wants short hair, so that's what she has.\"\n\nSilas, left, and Rosie, right, in 2017.\n\n\"Rosie's awesome. She's a firecracker,\" Stephani said.\n\nThey have told Rosie that her body is different from other people's but that many people have differences in their bodies. \"And that's OK,\" Eric said.\n\nIf Rosie ever expressed a desire to have a clitoral reduction, Eric said, they would begin the process by having her speak to a therapist, an intersex person who had surgery and an intersex person who has not had surgery.\n\n\"If that happens in a year, then we'll start it in a year, and if it happens when she's 16, then we'll do it then,\" he said.\n\nThey would urge her to wait until she's a teen, at least, and until she has experienced sexual pleasure, because of the procedure's potential effect on sexual sensations.\n\nRosie's been taking medication for CAH since she was a baby. She now takes three pills a day to keep her cortisol and electrolyte levels balanced. Pills swallowed at 7:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. prevent her from going into adrenal crisis.\n\nRosie's health is stable, and she's learning to care for her condition independently.\n\nWith this medical routine, Rosie's health is stabilized. She's beginning to learn how to take care of her condition independently and carries around a rescue kit in case she goes into adrenal crisis. But her parents are still concerned about what the future holds. Sicknesses and hospitalizations are inevitable with her condition, Eric said, and he's nervous about the quality of her health care when she's older -- as well as the possibility of schools and jobs being unforgiving about her having to take time off.\n\nEven though Rosie has been raised as a girl, it's important to her parents to refer to her as intersex and to encourage gender fluidity. In other words, they don't confine her gender expression to that of a boy or a girl.\n\nSince Rosie identifies as a girl, her parents check off \"female\" under the sex category when filling out forms. She's in first grade this year and has developed a group of core friends. She uses the girls' bathroom and has yet to be confronted by other students about her body. But they are confident that with her type of personality, she'll either not care or laugh about it, if anyone were to point out her differences.\n\nHer teachers are aware of her condition and have been compassionate, he said. Parents in their community have also been accepting.\n\n\"As of right now, she's very stable, and we have a very supportive network,\" Eric said. \"It's almost as if nobody cares about the intersex part of her.\"", "authors": ["Daniella Emanuel"], "publish_date": "2019-04-13 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410163319-08-rosie-lohman-family-photo-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191115092112-glass-house-slade-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161230124906-intersex-birth-certificate-large-169.jpeg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191113110515-05-venice-flooding-1112-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191112203339-mushroom-generic-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190705155958-ss-amazon-logo-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114104437-narwhal-puppy-02-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410162402-07-rosie-lohman-family-photos-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114102720-02-laurent-simons-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114214002-weed-thc-vaping-4-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114180752-tell-me-why-transgender-video-game-tyler-1-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410160437-01-rosie-lohman-family-photos-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114155248-blumenthal-gun-violence-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191113203506-color-correx-04-west-penn-newbords-cardigan-day-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114163818-crying-gop-voter-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171214141142-louvre-abu-dhabi-card-2-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190409152410-dollar-italy-dream-house---mussomeli-home---credit-salvatore-palumbo-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190517131834-02-minecraft-earth-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410161902-02-rosie-lohman-family-photos-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171108102422-cnnee-tercer-genero-sexo-trangenero-sexualidad-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410163204-06-rosie-lohman-family-photos-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410160437-01-rosie-lohman-family-photos-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190414224636-intersex-orig-photo-1-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190414224724-intersex-orig-photo-2-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410162048-03-rosie-lohman-family-photos-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181227142027-lynn-d-germany-third-gender-tease-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170102145605-02-kenya-intersex-community-tease-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410163426-05-rosie-lohman-family-photo-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114163108-gorgui-dieng-minnesota-timberwolves-nba-large-169.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Raising an intersex child: 'This is your body. ...

{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/private-jet-flight-attendant/index.html", "title": "Private jet flight attendant shares her flying confessions", "content": "(CNN) — For many, the thought of catching a plane is far from luxurious: from spending countless hours lining up at security, to wrestling arm rests with other passengers as you face a crammed long-haul flight in economy.\n\nBut somewhere else in the sky on board a private jet, high fliers are having their every need attended to while they enjoy their very own cinema, bedroom and living room.\n\nIt's a travel privilege enjoyed by a lucky few -- from celebrities, royals, self-made entrepreneurs and oligarchs. But the smooth running of private jets depends, usually, on a select few. Among the most attentive are flight attendants who spend hours, often alone, tirelessly ensuring their passengers receive a premium, 5-star service.\n\nMary Kalymnou has been working as a flight attendant for 13 years. Mary Kalymnou\n\nWhile life as a VIP air hostess comes with the perk of traveling the world, their jobs can be demanding and stressful.\n\nThey may serve their passengers every need, but the skills required by flight attendants are much more than that of a waitress -- they're cocktail mixologists, cleaners, personal assistants, caterers and even dog sitters.\n\nFlight attendant Kimberley Benton has been working in the industry for nine years. She says it was her love for traveling that drew her into the world, which has enabled her to embark on 14 world tours. During her lifetime, she's traveled to more than 130 countries and traveled on 27 different types of business jets.\n\nFor her, being a VIP flight attendant is more than just delivering the best possible service to her clients, but about \"creating an experience.\"\n\n\"They're expecting you to be a lot more personal,\" the 32-year-old told CNN Travel. \"They expect you to know exactly what they want, when they want it and it could be something as little as as soon as they get on the plane they want a shot of a Nespresso, the foot rest up and their Sunday Times [newspaper] waiting for them.\"\n\nShe's held birthday parties in the sky, after-parties for pop stars who she's flown with for their concert tours, and even put on full banquets for her guests. It's a job that requires her to be constantly adaptable to whatever situation she's in.\n\n\"Pop bands, royalty, millionaires, billionaires, heiresses,\" Benton lists as people she's flown with. \"I've [flown] a lot of people you see on TV and you can get a bit nervous, but when you fly these people you understand they're just like everyone else.\"\n\nAs for the parties, she says there's a need to make sure they \"don't get out of control.\"\n\n\"You kind of need to be on the ball a little bit -- not letting them drink too much, but not spoil the fun and kind of having a balance,\" Benton says.\n\nRelated content Private jet rentals: When you need one in a jiffy\n\n\"I've hosted a few parties in the sky before when I know they're going to have guests on board and they want all the champagne and ice ready to go,\" she adds. \"You want to make sure they've got everything they want -- their favorite whiskies and scotch,\" she adds.\n\nExotic parrots, guns and dead bodies\n\nMary Kalymnou has also worked as a flight attendant for 13 years, working for high-ranking international clientele such as royal families, heads of states, CEOs and celebrities.\n\nShe says she's worked on a variety of jets, including the long-range Gulfstream G550 and the Embraer Legacy which allows up to 14 passengers on board.\n\nKalymnou says she's flown for royal families, heads of states, CEOs and celebrities. Mary Kalymnou\n\nOn board she's had guests bring exotic parrots, jewels, more than 20 bags of shopping and even guns. She says she's also had dead bodies.\n\n\"Three times in my career I had a deceased person on board -- a coffin in the cargo, made out of gold and expensive wood,\" she recalls.\n\n\"They were three very well-known men, [who] obviously traveled in luxury for the last time in their lives.\"\n\nRelated content These are the most popular private jet destinations\n\nShe says the job of a VIP flight attendant is demanding and one that \"requires a lot of sacrifices.\"\n\n\"It requires a lot of patience, flexibility, and for sure -- high levels of self-esteem,\" Kalymnou explains. \"The clients expect the best, the operators demand the highest so you must be willing and of course be able to offer the best of yourself.\"\n\nOtherwise, she says, you could be easily replaced.\n\n\"Every girl could learn this job ... but only a few will eventually stand out. Being professional is not enough -- you must be unique,\" she says.\n\n\"You can easily be replaced by someone new, someone younger, someone prettier, someone smarter, someone more flexible. So since day one, I knew I had to be like a sponge in order to survive in the industry.\"\n\nKalymnou's career has led to her running the luxury travel and lifestyle blog, Maryhop. Mary Kalymnou\n\nKalymnou says in order to succeed a flight attendant needs to have \"premium catering skills, creative thinking, great manners as well as an elegant and hospitable attitude.\"\n\nHer career eventually led to her running the luxury travel and lifestyle blog and Instagram, Maryhop , which has gained over 23,000 followers and inspires others to pursue a career in aviation. She also provides one-on-one consulting to help others improve their customer service.\n\nTravel the world for $119,000\n\nBenton now works as a freelance flight attendant for TAG Aviation and various other operators that provide private and business aviation services.\n\nBut previously, Benton worked on board the Four Seasons' state-of-the-art luxury private jet . The Toronto-based luxury accommodation brand leased its very own Boeing 757 to fly up to 52 guests on global tours, setting back passengers $119,000 for a 24-day nine-destination trip.\n\nInterior of the Four Seasons private jet. Courtesy Four Seasons\n\n\"It's a private jet experience because the guests are on this aircraft for their full tour, it could be for four to five weeks and It's their aircraft, there's no one else getting on the plane,\" Benton explains.\n\nEach journey includes air travel, bespoke excursions, meals, drink and accommodation, she said.\n\n\"A lot of these guests are repeat guests and sometimes they do request the same crew on their next trip,\" Benton said, adding that eight attendants usually worked on board.\n\nHowever unlike on the Four Seasons flights, when Benton's operating smaller, more exclusive jets, she often works alone.\n\nBefore each flight, both Kalymnou and Benton have to organize catering for the flight -- which can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\"You could have a very low maintenance owner that doesn't want much, maybe just beans on toast and some might want a full banquet, family dinner and a five star service,\" Benton said says.\n\nMary Kalymnou\n\nWhile Kalymnou once received a last minute order from her client who requested a shark's fin soup on a flight out of London. The rare dish, which usually needs to be ordered 48 hours in advance, led Kalymnou to scramble.\n\n\"That was a difficult challenge as this was mainly forbidden in the UK and only certified suppliers and restaurants could actually deliver the order,\" she said.\n\n\"Having great connections in the UK, I managed to get the request on board just a few minutes before the passengers arrived,\" Kalymnou says. But after all the stress that she went through to get it on board, once she offered the menu to her guests they decided they wanted to carry on eating the burgers they had bought on the way to the airport instead.\n\n\"This is a typical example of our daily lives as VIP flight attendants. We strive for the best, even if it's not needed,\" she explained.\n\nKalymnou has to organize catering for the flight, which can sometimes be challenging due to guest demands. Mary Kalymnou\n\nFendi toilet seats and silk carpets\n\nOnce, Benton says, she worked on board a plane that was decorated with silk carpets throughout, and toilet seats made by the Italian luxury fashion house, Fendi.\n\n\"It was 100% pure silk carpet so you'd have to be aware of all the engineers coming on in their big boots. You'd be like 'oh god, please take your shoes off ... don't touch anything!',\" she laughs.\n\nBenton has worked in the industry for over nine years. Kimberley Benton\n\nThere was also a Formula One driver whose private jet had most things made out of carbon fiber.\n\n\"It was really expensive and he had all that and black leather,\" she remembers.\n\nBenton says while some large commercial airlines provide private rooms to customers if they want a more luxurious experience, it still can't compete with the exclusiveness of a private jet.\n\n\"You still haven't got the ability to change the schedule and that's what makes private so much more bespoke and tailored in comparison to commercial.\"\n\nWhile there isn't a set universal uniform for VIP flight attendants, Benton says that she has known some who have been required to wear platform high heels that have been bought for them by the jet owner.\n\n\"I do know people who have to wear Louboutins in and outside the cabin,\" Benton reveals. But usually, she says, owners just like them to look presentable -- with simple hair and makeup.\n\nLiving life on 'permanent standby'\n\nLife as a flight attendant is a job that can put Benton on \"permanent standby,\" where you may not know where you'll end up in 48 hours or even two weeks.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't always get the opportunity to fully have a day off,\" Benton adds.\n\nShe says as a freelancer, flight attendants can earn anywhere from £150 ($195) to £450 ($587) a day, depending on your experience and what you can negotiate with the operator.\n\n\"There's no set salary,\" she adds. \"Everyone's got their own little deal going on.\"\n\nBenton says the biggest perk of her job is being able to meet new people and see new places.

So keep medicine out of it.\"\n\nIt's a test based on myths and outdated ideas\n\nThe so-called \"virginity test\" is typically performed one of two ways:\n\nInspecting the hymen for tears or looking at its size and shape.\n\nThrough the \"two-finger test,\" which involves inserting fingers into the vagina.\n\nBut the practice, doctors say, is based on a misunderstanding of the female body and outdated notions of \"purity.\"\n\n\"There's this idea that the hymen is this barrier that remains intact until some Prince Charming comes and 'opens it' and 'pops the cherry,'\" said Ranit Mishori, senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights and professor of family medicine at Georgetown University. \"All of these horrendous ways of addressing the hymen are patently wrong.\"\n\nThough people often think the hymen completely covers the vaginal opening, in most cases, it simply surrounds it, Gunter said. During sexual intercourse, it can sometimes be torn or stretched. But it can also tear or stretch through tampon use, sporting activities or medical procedures.\n\nSo, it's extremely difficult, doctors say, for them to determine whether any change to the hymen is a result of penetrative sex or other causes.\n\nAnother supposed indicator of \"virginity\" is the presence of blood on the sheets after a woman has sex for the first time That's a myth too.\n\nStudies have refuted the idea that most women bleed the first time they have sex. If they do, it's typically light spotting. What bleeding can indicate, however, is forced penetration or a lack of lubrication, Mishori wrote in a journal article.\n\nIt can have harmful consequences\n\nVirginity tests can have damaging psychological consequences for girls and women.\n\nThey can cause feelings of guilt, self-disgust, depression, anxiety and a negative body image, several UN agencies said in a statement calling for an end to the practice. In many cases, they're performed at the request of family members or partners, often without consent.\n\nBecause there's no equivalent for men, virginity tests imply that sex before marriage is only unacceptable for women.\n\n\"If someone's asking for a hymen check, then what they're saying to you is that it's wrong to have sex before marriage,\" Gunter told CNN.\n\nSometimes, the consequences of virginity testing are physical.\n\nThe sexual stigma perpetuated by the tests can drive women to risky behaviors. They might opt for oral or anal sex to preserve their virginity, doctors say, which can lead to sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, if practiced without protection.\n\nIt's based on a narrow definition of sex\n\nPeople who request virginity tests as evidence of whether a girl or a woman has had sex are missing the point, Mishori said.\n\nThere are many other ways to have sex besides vaginal penetration, and simply inspecting the hymen will not yield any instructive answers about whether a woman is sexually active, she said.\n\nAnother issue is that the tests don't respect a woman's autonomy and integrity, Mishori added: Why should a woman need to go through an exam to prove something about her sexual history? Why wouldn't society simply believe what she says?\n\n\"It's about trusting women, believing women and taking them at face value rather than subjecting them to outsiders being the arbiters of their behaviors, lifestyles or purity or character,\" she said.\n\nFinally, the idea that someone would even feel the need to assess whether a woman has had sex is a signal of how society determines her worth and desirability, Mishori said.\n\n\"There are a lot of social norms that all come into play through that little tiny piece of tissue,\" she said.\n\nUnfortunately, those social norms and misconceptions have formed over a long period of time, Mishori said, and dismantling them will be a challenge that extends beyond medical professionals.\n\nAnd if the news this week is any indication, there's still a lot of work to be done.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2019-11-09 00:00:00", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170511120131-fgm-in-united-states-0511-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160620150946-abortion-photo-illustration-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191108143158-doctors-silhouette-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191108143158-doctors-silhouette-super-tease.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "'Virginity tests' are unreliable and invasive", "but doctors still get asked to perform them - CNN"], "tags": "health"}
{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/04/health/keto-worst-diet-2018/index.html", "title": "'Best diets' ranking puts keto last, DASH first", "content": "(CNN) If you're a fan of the \"fat-burning\" keto diet, you'll be fired up about its ranking in the 2018 list of best diets from US News and World Report: It's tied for last, along with the relatively unknown Dukan diet .\n\nBoth stress eating a ton of protein or fat and minimal carbs, putting the dieter into \"ketosis,\" when the body breaks down both ingested and stored body fat into ketones, which it uses as energy. People on such diets often deal with fatigue and light-headedness as they adjust to a lack of carbohydrates\n\nThough the experts on the US News and World Report panel that created the list said eating that way isn't harmful short-term, they ranked the diets poorly on long-term weight loss success, ease of use and overall impact on health.\n\nFor the relatively new keto diet, the experts were especially concerned about extremely high fat content -- about 70% of daily calorie intake -- as well as unusually low carbohydrate levels: only 15 to 20 net carbs a day. The 2015-20 dietary guidelines for Americans suggest that 45% to 65% of daily calories come from carbs but less than 10% from saturated fat.\n\n\"When you are on the keto diet, you drastically cut your carbs to only 20 per day. That's less than one apple!\" said nutritionist Lisa Drayer, a CNN contributor. \"The keto diet is just not sustainable over the long term. It doesn't teach you how to acquire healthy eating habits. It's good for a quick fix, but most people I know can hardly give up pasta and bread, let alone beans and fruit.\"\n\nThe expert panel was particularly concerned for people with liver or kidney conditions, \"who should avoid it altogether,\" the report said, adding that there was not enough evidence to know whether the diet would help those with heart issues or diabetes. Because of the recommended \"cycling\" nature of the diet, taking breaks and then starting it again, experts also warn that hormones could fluctuate.\n\nAnother popular low-carb diet, Whole30, was also at the bottom of the list, just before keto and Dukan. Whole30 is a 30-day diet designed to end \"unhealthy cravings and habits, restore a healthy metabolism, heal your digestive tract and balance your immune system,\" according to its website.\n\nThe panel slammed the diet as having \"No independent research. Nonsensical claims. Extreme. Restrictive.\" and tied it with the raw food diet as \"the worst of the worst for healthy eating.\"\n\nFirst place is a tie\n\nFor the first time, the well-researched Mediterranean diet moved into first place, tied with the DASH diet. DASH, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, has held the top spot for eight consecutive years. Both diets also tied for healthiest in the rankings.\n\n\"What I love about both the DASH and Mediterranean diets is that they offer guiding principles for eating, like eating more fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts and low-fat dairy foods,\" Drayer said. \"I personally love the fact that a daily glass of red wine is encouraged as part of the Mediterranean diet.\"\n\nThe DASH diet is often recommended to lower blood pressure. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat and limit your intake of salt.\n\nThe meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes.\n\nStudies have shown that following this diet can reduce blood pressure in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet also ranked first on the US News and World Report list for easiest diet to follow, best plant-based diet and best diet for diabetes. It came in second for best heart-healthy diet, just behind DASH.\n\nThe diet emphasizes simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil. Say goodbye to refined sugar or flour. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all.\n\nMeat can make a rare appearance, but usually only to flavor a dish. Meals may include eggs, dairy and poultry, but in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. However, fish are a staple, and an optional glass of wine with dinner is on the menu.\n\nPhotos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods The Mediterranean diet is easy to find in the grocery store, contains nutrients that are known to enhance longevity and has other health benefits that are backed by peer-reviewed, scientific studies. Broccoli makes the list because it's one of nature's most nutrient-dense foods, with only 30 calories per cup. That means you get a ton of hunger-curbing fiber and polyphenols -- antioxidants that detoxify cell-damaging chemicals in your body -- with each serving. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Doctors suggest using olive oil rather than butter to make your meals. A Spanish study found a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events among patients with a history of heart disease. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Quinoa is the popular whole-grain du jour because it also contains a good dose of protein to help build muscle. Yet including any type of whole grain in your diet -- from barley to brown rice -- will aid in weight loss by filling you up for fewer calories. Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Blueberries are often singled out as a kind of superfood because studies have shown they aid in everything from fighting cancer to lowering cholesterol. But all berries, including raspberries, strawberries and blackberries, contain antioxidants and phytonutrients . Worried about the price of fresh fruit? Experts say the frozen kind is just fine. Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Many dieters shy away from nuts because of their high calorie and fat count. But studies show that eating a handful several times a week can prevent heart disease and ultimately help you shed pounds since they fill you up and stop you from snacking on other things. Almonds, in particular, contain lots of monounsaturated fats and fiber. (Healthy swap: Replace peanut butter with almond butter.) Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Salmon is also a good source of lean protein. With this diet, doctors suggest eating fish at least two times a week. Salmon provides a high dose of omega-3 fatty acids, which studies show significantly lower the risk of heart disease. Omega-3 fatty acids fight back by reducing inflammation and slowing the rate of plaque buildup in blood vessels. Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Beans, beans, the magical fruit; the more you eat, the more ... you lose weight. Black, kidney, white and garbanzo beans (also known as chickpeas) are good for fiber and protein. They fill you up and provide muscle-building material without any of the fat that meat can add to your meal. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Eating a breakfast high in protein is a good way to keep hunger at bay throughout the day. Eggs are full of choline, a nutrient that helps block fat from being absorbed in the liver. Choline may also help in preventing memory loss. Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Spinach is a great source of iron, which is a key component in red blood cells that fuel our muscles with oxygen for energy. But researchers in Sweden identified another way in which these greens might keep you charged: Compounds found in spinach actually increase the efficiency of our mitochondria , the energy-producing factories inside our cells. That means eating a cup of cooked spinach a day may give you more lasting power on the elliptical machine (or in your daily sprint to catch the bus). Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Walnuts are packed with tryptophan, an amino acid your body needs to create the feel-great chemical serotonin. (In fact, Spanish researchers found that walnut eaters have higher levels of this natural mood-regulator.) Another perk: \"They're digested slowly,\" said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale Prevention Research Center. \"This contributes to mood stability and can help you tolerate stress.\" Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods Asparagus is one of the best veggie sources of folate, a B vitamin that could help keep you out of a mental slump. \"Folate is important for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine,\" said David Mischoulon, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. All of these are crucial for mood. Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Delicious Mediterranean diet foods It's not a requirement to drink it on this diet, but if you do drink alcohol, red wine in moderate amounts can be good for your health. Moderation means one drink for women and two for men, by the way. Studies show red wine can help protect against heart disease. Hide Caption 12 of 12\n\nThe flexitarian diet came in third on the list of best overall diets for its emphasis on whole grains, fruits, veggies and plant-based proteins. It's basically a vegetarian diet that allows the occasional piece of meat or fish, thus making it \"flexible.\"\n\nThe ever-popular Weight Watchers diet was ranked fourth, followed by the MIND diet, a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH diets that some may find a bit easier to follow, as it requires less fish and fruit.\n\nBoth the MIND diet and the Mediterranean diet have been shown in studies to lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBest weight-loss diets\n\nWeight Watchers topped the list of best weight-loss and best commercial diet plans, and it tied with HMR for best fast weight-loss diet. HMR, the Health Management Resources program, involves purchasing meal replacements, such as shakes, nutrition bars and multigrain cereals, and adding vegetables and fruits to round out the meals.\n\nSince 2015, Weight Watchers has been focused on its Beyond the Scale program. It is designed to help people move more and focus on overall well-being, including more \"me\" time, which includes mindfulness and self-compassion.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe US News and World Report expert panel -- made up of 25 experts from major medical centers across the country -- gave Weight Watchers top points for being healthy, also stressing the importance of support for dieters.\n\nPointing to a 2006 British Medical Journal study , the panel said that \"programs like Weight Watchers that offer emotional support and group meetings lead to higher compliance than a do-it-yourself dieting.\"\n\nDrayer agreed: \"I've always been a fan of Weight Watchers because it teaches you how to incorporate all types of foods into your diet, and it also offers a support component, which can be extremely beneficial.\"\n\nBut whatever diet you choose, she recommends choosing the one that fits your lifestyle and that you can stick to over the long term.\n\n\"I always recommend meeting with a registered dietitian, who can take into account your health history, lifestyle habits, likes and dislikes, and develop an eating plan that is specific to your needs,\" she added. \"I also recommend checking with your doctor first before starting any new diet plan.\"", "authors":

{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/01/tech/airpods-pro-hands-on/index.html", "title": "AirPods Pro: A $249 product so good you're willing to risk losing it", "content": "New York (CNN Business) I had a pair of new $249 AirPods Pro for less than 12 minutes when one tumbled out of my ear and landed an inch from the edge of a train platform.\n\n\"I really thought you were going to go after it if it fell,\" the stranger next to me scoffed.\n\nThe high-end earbuds are a lot of things: an audiophile's dream, a fashion statement, Snoopy's face in headphone form. But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\n\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product.\n\nIn a sense, this isdoing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones.\n\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\n\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes , mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\n\nApple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it.\n\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned , with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\n\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\n\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ.\n\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\n\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud.\n\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem.\n\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\n\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car.\n\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\n\nWow. People line up for AirPods Pro now (Grand Central Apple Store this morning for the launch) pic.twitter.com/2I4SRB3nyg — Samantha Murphy Kelly (@HeySamantha) October 30, 2019\n\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right. AirPod loyalists are fanatical about the earbuds, and the love for them is about to get even deeper.\n\nBuzz around the new Pro version will undoubtedly convince other Apple users to make a purchase, too. They'll also soon know the pain and anguish of (almost) losing a fallen earpiece.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2019-11-01 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191031165341-04-sam-kelly-airpods-pro-review-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191028135414-airpods-pro-apple-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190927121159-teemill-for-dv-1-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191106133828-ups-cvs-drone-delivery-prescription-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190807104825-01-samantha-kelly-testing-5g-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919125647-mate-30-phone-0919-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181217084838-20181217-russia-social-media-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191015111138-fortnite-update-chapter-2-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016081511-29-google-live-event-1015-pixel-recorder-transcribe-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191024095159-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191031165143-02-sam-kelly-airpods-pro-review-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191031165341-04-sam-kelly-airpods-pro-review-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191031165248-03-sam-kelly-airpods-pro-review-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180518174815-paypal-hq-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190626084522-instagram-app-explore-stock-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191031165025-01-sam-kelly-airpods-pro-review-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191031165025-01-sam-kelly-airpods-pro-review-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191018101636-gfx-social-engineering-hack-donie-02-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190111093239-20190111-innovate-logo-large-169.png", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191023102937-02-facebook-libra-hearing-zuckerberg-testifying-1023-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016145031-20191016-google-pixel-4-gfx-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191108174259-mit-mini-cheetah-robot-soccer-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181218205050-softbank-file-large-169.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["tech", "The AirPods Pro are a $249 product worth the risk of losing - CNN"], "tags": "tech"}

{"home": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/11/health/improve-emotional-intelligence/index.html", "title": "Emotional intelligence: What is it, and why does it matter?", "content": "It's our emotional intelligence that gives us the ability to read our instinctive feelings and those of others. It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them, according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.\n\nMost of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.\n\nBut many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence, according to Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.\n\nThat's important because experts say the ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health, happiness and personal and professional success.\n\nSo maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.\n\nWhat is emotional intelligence?\n\nThe theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey, the 23rd president of Yale University, and John \"Jack\" Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, wrote up the theory in 1990, Brackett said.\n\nTheir work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior, said Robin Stern, associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator, author and licensed psychoanalyst.\n\nExperts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. \"Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions,\" she said.\n\nIt's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others, said Sara Canaday, a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic, can look at situations from an alternative point of view, are considered open-minded, bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face, according to Canaday.\n\n\"Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world,\" Stern said.\n\n\"People with more emotional intelligence are healthier, happier and more effective,\" Brackett said.\n\nWhy emotional intelligence matters\n\nCanaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive résumé or a high IQ score\n\nWait, really?\n\nWell ... just reflect on your own work experiences, Canaday suggests.\n\nHas anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave, even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?\n\n\"We might be hired for technical talents, but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence,\" Canaday said.\n\nIndividuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful, she said, but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence.\n\n\"It is how well you can collaborate, how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell, the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart.\"\n\nEmotional intelligence tests\n\nBehavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments, usually broken down into \"your ability to manage yourself, your ability to manage relationships, your self-awareness and your social awareness,\" according to Canaday.\n\nYour results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence.\n\nBut Brackett warns that \"measurement is a tricky subject.\"\n\nIn his early research, he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence, which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment, people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way, their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them.\n\nAnother form of an emotional intelligence test is a \"360 assessment.\"\n\nIn the workplace setting, a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often \"see ourselves differently than others do.\"\n\nWhen a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser, perhaps a current or former boss, to evaluate your emotional intelligence, she said.\n\nBut, Canaday cautions, If you ask for someone's feedback, be prepared to accept what they share. \"This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand, we say we want to learn and grow, but on the other hand, we want to be accepted just the way we are, and those two human traits run counter.\"\n\nCan I improve my emotional intelligence?\n\nSo maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that?\n\nFrom the earliest ages, children should be taught how to recognize their emotions, understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves , Stern said.\n\nFor adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence, improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. \"Pick one or two areas where you want to grow, and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop.\"\n\nIf you are trying to gain better control of your anger, for example, you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga meditation or boxing\n\nCanaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. \"Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do, then you are hearing the same conversations, and you are not growing, and you are not learning to be open to perspectives.\"\n\nBrackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to \"spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions, be more self- and socially aware about your presence.\"\n\nStern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause, slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"There is no question in my mind that if people were to really appreciate how important emotions are, allowed themselves to have emotions, made space for other people to have their emotions and handled those emotions skillfully in the service of making a better world, we would in fact have a better world.\"", "authors": ["Erin Gabriel"], "publish_date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180221172126-upset-couple-stock-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161005105104-spontaneous-emotions-brain-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170412090122-compassion-happiness-training-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180221172126-upset-couple-stock-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111109021323-overworked-employee-story-top.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Emotional intelligence: What is it", "and why does it matter? - CNN"], "tags": "health"}

The accommodation debate", "content": "(CNN) — Where you stay makes all the difference on the road. Even if you only plan to spend your sleeping hours in a hotel room or apartment or rental home, inconvenient or unappealing accommodations can detract from -- or ruin -- an otherwise lovely trip.\n\nThe range of choices and amenities is vast, but one of the key decisions these days is whether to go with a traditional hotel room or opt for a rental property through Airbnb or a similar site with listings from ultraluxurious villas to bare-bones guest rooms.\n\nFluffy bathrobes, turndown service and breakfast in bed or a private residence with DIY meal possibilities and room to spread out?\n\nWeighing in on this debate are two CNN Travel staffers. We also want to hear your rationale. Please submit your reasons for booking a hotel or a rental property in the form below.\n\nRelated content How early do you get to the airport? The great timing debate\n\nTRIED-AND-TRUE: A CASE FOR HOTEL ROOMS\n\nLilit Marcus is a New York City-based editor at CNN Travel and an unrepentant road warrior. She also hates making her bed.\n\nWhen I think about going on vacation, I think about one word: relaxing.\n\nWhich of these situations is more relaxing to you: standing in the middle of a street trying to siphon Wi-Fi from a neighborhood restaurant, carrying all your luggage and being jet lagged as hell while you desperately try to pull up an email from your Airbnb host containing the key code for their apartment building, or having a concierge whisk you and your bags upstairs to a cozy room so that you can immediately fall asleep?\n\nYeah, that's what I thought.\n\nRelated content To check or carry on? Luggage choices get heated\n\nIt's not relaxing to make your own bed\n\nAs a woman who travels alone all over the world, I find it comforting to know which things I can control and which ones I can't. A 24-hour reception desk staffed by people who speak a range of languages feels immensely comforting in an unfamiliar place, not to mention safe.\n\nI have been chased down streets, harassed by taxi drivers and nearly assaulted in the course of my travels. But I always heave a happy sigh of relief when I arrive at the front door to my hotel.\n\nDoes your house look like this? My house doesn't. Dorchester Collection\n\nLike airports, hotels seem to exist in their own separate world. Need a full meal at 3 a.m. because you're wide awake with a walloping case of jet lag? Consider it done. Want to immediately wash the clothes that got soaked in an unexpected downpour? No need to figure out how to use a foreign washing machine -- just dial zero for reception.\n\nIf I wanted to make my own bed and clean my own bathroom, I'd stay home. Travel is supposed to be about trying new things, not doing the same boring ones in slightly different circumstances.\n\nRelated content In defense of being a tourist\n\nBeing a local is overrated\n\nYes, I like its general ethos of venturing to less-crowded areas and indulging in hole-in-the-wall restaurants. But not every aspect of being a local is fun.\n\nI live in Manhattan. For me \"being a local\" isn't just about going to Broadway shows -- it also means shoving my way onto a crowded rush hour subway train, waiting an hour in line to get a salad at lunch and lugging my trash down six flights of stairs because the elevator in my building is broken again.\n\nYou didn't know you needed your newspaper ironed every morning until you stayed here. Aman Venice\n\nDoes that sound fun and glamorous to you? Because it doesn't to me. If I have the chance to experience New York City like a tourist by staying at a hotel, I'll happily take it.\n\nSo much of travel is about learning how to navigate new and unfamiliar experiences. I love to get lost in a cute neighborhood or try a food that I've never heard of before. But not every single component of being in a different place is sacred. You can do all of those \"not a local\" experiences ... and then end the day at the hotel pool.\n\nLoyalty has its pluses\n\nThere's another major reason I love hotels: the points.\n\nTravel can beget more travel by working your loyalty programs. Just like I hoard frequent flier miles and use them judiciously for trips I can't afford on my own, being loyal to my hotel brands of choice makes it more likely I can afford a free room or a fancy upgrade the next time around.\n\nAnd it's not just about redeeming points in the loyalty game. Having status with a given hotel brand often means you get free upgrades, personalized greetings, your favorite snacks in your room waiting for you on check-in and other perks.\n\nThis hotel bar has a spirits collection way more impressive than any rental. NoMad Hotel\n\nFor example, I'm a tea drinker and not a coffee person, but my favorite hotel chain knows this info and makes sure there's tea and a kettle already in the room before I even get a chance to ask. What's more luxurious than that?\n\nHotels also provide some cushion for those critical oh-wait-did-I-forget-something moments that even the most savvy traveler has sometimes. Their outlets often work for multiple kinds of plugs, meaning you don't need to pack a bagful of adapters, and there's someone who can bring you toothpaste to your door if you forgot to pack it yourself.\n\nTravel is exciting, but it can also make you feel very vulnerable. You're in a new place where you might not speak the language, you don't know your way around, the weather's totally different than what you left at home, and you're exhausted. Hotels can eliminate some of these logistics-related pain points and give you more time and energy to focus on the things you're really excited about.\n\nLOCAL FLAVOR FOR LESS: THE VACATION RENTAL ARGUMENT\n\nAtlanta-based editor Marnie Hunter loves a good value in a great location and likes pretending to live in walkable neighborhoods where coffee and snacks are just steps away. And she needs her space.\n\nTravel is expensive and more travel = more fun. I have a hard time plunking down hundreds of dollars a night before I've even started eating, drinking and exploring. So, vacation rentals are my go-to. More space for less money on lodging means more money for everything else.\n\nNever underestimate having your own space\n\nI'm a light and uneven sleeper. I wear ear plugs at home by myself. With a fan on. I travel frequently with friends and -- not naming names -- some of them snore.\n\nI need my own room.\n\nI'll gladly sleep in a slim European single or on a futon with one blanket, if I can have that quiet space to myself. In fact, I find the global hotel market's embrace of duvets very troubling; I am not a person who needs enforced Alpine-ski-lodge coziness in July.\n\nWith a vacation rental, the cost of two or more bedrooms is often comparable to a hotel room and definitely far cheaper than booking multiple rooms in a comfortable and conveniently located hotel in a popular destination.\n\nYou can buy perishables and breakfast won't cost you $40\n\nYou have the added benefit of refrigeration. A full kitchen, really, but I tend to lean heavily on the full-sized fridge to store my market goodies -- cheeses, pate, charcuterie, olives and so on. Sometimes pastries. Mostly cheeses. Breakfast can be prepared. Dinner even.\n\nIn San Sebastian, Spain, the apartment a friend and I rented had an electric juicer. Five kilos of oranges later, we started our days with the freshest, tastiest OJ I'd ever had. Then we strolled down our narrow street for sidewalk-café espresso done right.\n\nYou can also buy life-sized bottles of wine or liquor and drink it out of proper glasses without the exponential hotel mini-bar mark up.\n\nAll of these things can be stored in your very own rental kitchen. Marnie Hunter/CNN\n\nThe residency fantasy is real\n\nI'm pretty thrifty, yes, but I will pay for design. I'm not looking for the most elegant apartment on the rental market -- can't afford it.\n\nBut what I am buying, somewhat guiltily, is the fantasy of living somewhere in a style that looks accessible (but would no doubt be well beyond my means in the places I'm visiting).\n\nI'll take that fantasy over a five-star hotel any day.\n\nAnd when you do want to stretch into a new bracket of luxury living, there are rentals that offer next-level glamor that's more personalized than a luxury hotel.\n\nPied-à-terre in central Paris?

The identities of the astronauts were not included in the study.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have observed these conditions in astronauts and the implications of their discovery could impact future long-term spaceflight, such as a mission to Mars.\n\nAfter more than 50 years of human spaceflight, researchers know some of the risks posed to the human body by being in zero gravity. Space motion sickness happens in the first 48 hours, creating a loss of appetite, dizziness and vomiting.\n\nOver time, astronauts staying for six months on the station can experience the weakening and loss of bone and atrophying muscles. Astronauts also experience blood volume loss, weakened immune systems and cardiovascular deconditioning, since floating takes little effort and the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood. Scott Kelly and other astronauts in their late 40s and 50s have also complained about their vision being slightly altered. Some of them have required glasses in flight.\n\nAnd the Twins Study, comparing changes in astronaut Scott Kelly during his yearlong spaceflight mission while his twin, Mark, was on Earth revealed numerous other changes affecting gene expression and the microbiome.\n\nThe weightless environment of zero gravity causes a fluid shift in the body toward the head, the opposite of what we experience standing on Earth. On Earth, humans spend about two-thirds of the day in an upright position and about a third laying down at night. This causes a daily fluid shift that varies based on our position.\n\nBut for astronauts, the fluid shift is sustained for long periods of time. It causes puffiness in the face, \"bird leg\" syndrome where the legs lose volume, and decreases plasma volume while increasing stroke volume -- the volume of blood pumped per beat.\n\n\"A recently identified medical issue with long duration spaceflight on the International Space Station is a constellation of neuro-ocular issues that we've coined SANS -- Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome,\" said Michael Stenger, study author and director of NASA's Johnson Space Center Cardiovascular and Vision Laboratory.\n\n\"Approximately 10 years ago, we noticed that astronauts were developing optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds and permanent refractive error changes. The purpose of our experiment was to quantify the headward fluid shift in all astronauts by examining arterial and venous structure and flow characteristics in the head and neck (as well as several other parameters) and determining the relationship between these parameters and ocular structural and functional changes.\"\n\nThe researchers wanted to assess how this fluid shift affected the left jugular vein. This vein carries deoxygenated blood from the head and neck to the vena cava, the largest vein in the upper body.\n\nThe researchers disclosed that one limitation of the study is that they did not image the right jugular vein, but it has been analyzed in previous spaceflight studies and there was no sign of stagnation or clotting.\n\nThe astronauts provided blood flow measurements before and after spaceflight while seated, laying down and angled at a 15-degree downward head-tilt. Measurements during the flight were taken on days 50 and 150 of the mission.\n\nThe astronaut who developed a blood clot was treated with anticoagulants for the rest of the spaceflight and did not participate in the study past day 50.\n\nThe observation that blood was clotting in otherwise healthy astronauts, both male and female, due to weightlessness was a surprise to researchers, who are concerned due to the other issues blood clots can cause.\n\n\"Blood clots that are newly formed and small are easily filtered out of the circulation in the lungs,\" Stenger said. \"If one were to grow excessively large and solidify, then one would be at risk of a pulmonary embolism. This formation of clots is the primary concern related to flow stasis.\"\n\nThe idea of reverse blood flow requires more scrutiny.\n\n\"Reverse flow is really interesting, and we're uncertain if it harmful,\" Stenger said. \"Reverse flow in the jugular vein could be completely harmless as the blood is simply leaving the head via one of the other venous pathways. However, reverse flow implies altered venous pressure dynamics, which could impact the ability of the brain to drain cerebral spinal fluid and possibly increase pressure in the brain. This is something we're continuing to investigate.\"\n\nA possible way to reverse the head-ward fluid shift is to apply lower body negative pressure.\n\nThe Russian side of the space station includes a Chibis suit that was used to test this method. The suit basically acts as vacuum-sealed pants, according to the study authors.\n\n\"It encompasses the lower limbs in a hard enclosure that is sealed at the waist and connected to a vacuum pump to decrease the pressure in the chamber around the lower limbs to subatmospheric pressure,\" the authors wrote. \"Lower body negative pressure sequesters fluid volume, mainly venous blood, in the lower extremities and is used by cosmonauts on the ISS as a countermeasure for postflight orthostatic intolerance.\"\n\nOther possible ways to shift fluid from the upper body could include thigh cuffs, resistance breathing devices and acceleration via cetrifugation, Stenger said.\n\nStenger pointed out that research should be fast-tracked to better understand the issue, as well as considering the limits on medical and research capabilities on vehicles used in future exploration missions.\n\n\"As potentially scary as this may sound, this novel and interesting finding isn't terribly concerning,\" Stenger said. \"The reality is that this has probably been happening since we started flying in space, we just never looked before. This gives us the opportunity to now conduct further research to determine what is causing this before speculating too much on potential consequences.'\n\nOf the 17 sessions with the Chibis suit during flight, 10 were associated with improved blood flow, two actually showed worsened flow and five did not cause any changes, according to the study. During sessions when blood flow improved, three astronauts actually went from stagnant or reverse blood flow to regular.\n\n\"This study underscores the need to monitor vascular changes in astronauts,\" said Christopher Mason, one of the Twins Study authors and an associate professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine. Mason was not affiliated with this study. \"Stagnant and retrograde blood flow can lead to complications, such as thrombosis [blood clotting], but fortunately can be tracked and treated. Also, just like taking a long flight, the risk of this would almost certainly resolve upon landing back on Earth.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2019-11-15 00:00:00", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191114095921-03-astronaut-training-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170331104342-astronaut-space-walk-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150825105557-spacescience-logo-large-169.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190529123117-after-the-moon-mars-1-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170208164636-my-hero-sanjay-gupta-kelly-twins-00014004-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170324093351-01-space-walk-file-super-tease.jpeg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141111162617-mercury-7-nasa-story-top.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-full-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160302222001-02-soctt-kelly-0302-exlarge-169.jpeg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["health", "Astronauts experienced reverse blood flow and blood clots on the space station", "study says - CNN"], "tags": "health"}

The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) Every January for the past 20 years, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question \"what is the meaning of life?\"\n\nIt's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.\n\nThis simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.\n\nThe connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown), but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.\n\nThe reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.\n\nGreat thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is \"to serve others and to do good,\" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, \"The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity.\" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, \"if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.\"\n\nScottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, \"The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to \"throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.\"\n\n\"Love\" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, \"The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.\"\n\nMy favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, \"The purpose of life is a life of purpose.\"\n\nSome have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. \"There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,\" Anaïs Nin wrote in her diary. \"There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.\"\n\nI agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. \"Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,\" wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, well-known for his book \"The Little Prince.\"\n\nTaking a few moments to record your answer to the question \"what is the meaning of life?\" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.\n\nAnd then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.\n\nIn 1997, my answer was \"the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,\" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make \"the world a better place.\" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply \"Love.\" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic \"continuation of one's DNA to the next generation.\" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nAs a practical matter, if you want to do the annual \"Meaning\" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.\n\nThe last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If \"love,\" is the answer, then love more. If it's \"find your bliss,\" then get searching for it.\n\nThis is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful, and longer, life.", "authors": ["David G.

It's all made within the center of the city,\" says Christensen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-11-13 01:26:32", "images": ["https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F181112105019-hanoi-sidecar-tours.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F181112105019-hanoi-sidecar-tours-super-tease.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F171220172042-best-beaches-promo.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["travel-play", "See Hanoi's Old Quarter from the sidecar of a motorbike - CNN"], "tags": "index.html"}

Introduced in 1849, Araminta Ross, or \"Minty\" as she's known, has already seen her sisters sold away.\n\nFacing the same fate, she makes a desperate bid for freedom, fleeing from slaveholder Gideon Brodess (Joe Alwyn) and enduring a perilous 100-mile journey that eventually brings her to Philadelphia.\n\nOnce there, she receives assistance from free blacks (Leslie Odom Jr., Janelle Monae), before deciding that she must brave returning home in order to lead other members of her family to freedom. Ignoring warnings about the danger, she heads back, guided by her religious faith and a belief that God is directing her.\n\n\"Don't you tell me what I can't do,\" Harriet says defiantly, well aware of the ordeal that awaits her if she's captured on one of those trips, which prompt real-time mythologizing of \"Moses,\" the mysterious figure leading slaves to the promised land, who some plantation owners assumed to be a white man wearing blackface.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "publish_date": "2019-10-31 00:00:00", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025130921-harriet-cynthia-erivo-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190723132417-02-harriet-tubman-trailer-screengrab-super-tease.jpg"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["entertainment", "'Harriet' review - CNN"], "tags": "entertainment"}
