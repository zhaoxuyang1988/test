He’s always striving for more and he’s a good role model and that’s obviously why he’s been made captain.\n\n“He’s somebody who leads by example and somebody in whose footsteps everybody would like to follow.”\n\nTonight’s final qualifier against Kosovo in Pristina is very much a Euro 2020 trial for Winks, 23.\n\nHe is set for a third successive England appearance but just his sixth in total.\n\nWinks added: “Every time I get the opportunity to play for my club and country, it’s important that I can put in a positive performance because I want to play in this team and I want to do myself justice.\n\n“We want to top the group, of course, with as many points as we possibly can and with regards to seeding it’s important.\n\n“There’s a lot of competition at the moment in this group and everybody is performing so well for their clubs.\n\n“There are so many players that are pushing for positions and places, and as long as I stay on top of my game and as long as everybody else does as well, it will be a good selection problem for the gaffer.”\n\n3 Harry Winks is set for a third successive England cap against Kosovo\n\nBut Winks’ Spurs season has not gone to plan so far.\n\nHe was left at home by boss Mauricio Pochettino for the Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade and was benched against Sheffield United.\n\nWinks said: “I never spoke to the manager about why I was left out but I assumed it was tactical.

Just head down, sleeves rolled up and an “I’ll prove them all wrong” attitude.\n\nAnd now, of course, he is a fixture in both the Liverpool and England sides. A man whose absence is noted, rather than presence questioned by club and country.\n\n6\n\nYou’d never get a reaction from the man himself now opinions have changed for the good, any more than there were before.\n\nSo maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that this week he played an absolute blinder and didn’t get more than a mention in passing.\n\nHenderson, as we know, wasn’t due to join England until Wednesday as he was banned for the Montenegro game.\n\nInstead, when Raheem Sterling lost his rag and the Joe Gomez bust-up came to light, he went down a day early.\n\nBy then though, he had already telephoned both players to help broker the peace — and in Sterling’s case, he did him a huge favour.\n\nThe Manchester City striker actually left the squad for 20 minutes or so on Monday.\n\n6 When Raheem Sterling lost his rag and the Joe Gomez bust-up came to light, Henderson went down a day early Credit: Reuters\n\nSome say it was simply because he wanted to escape for a while to calm down.\n\nBut what if that wasn’t the case? What if he had walked out and not gone back?\n\nWhat repercussions would there have been then? Certainly more than just being dropped for Thursday.\n\nHenderson, who knows both Sterling and Gomez well, helped talk him down and talk him round, ending any doubts the player may have had about returning to St George’s.\n\nHad he not done so, an incident which became bigger news than the fixture itself, wouldn’t be drawing to a conclusion. Not for the foreseeable, either.\n\nWho knows? If Sterling had turned his back on England now, he could have been doing so for the long-term — either by his own choice or the manager’s.\n\n6 Liverpool captain Henderson knows both Sterling and Gomez well Credit: Rex Features\n\nWhatever the outcome, they wouldn’t have been good for either the player or the team.\n\nSo for his part in all this, Henderson deserves nothing but praise. His role as peacemaker was just as important as Gareth Southgate’s.\n\nYou can only imagine Jordan’s thoughts when those morons booed Gomez’ introduction on Thursday.\n\nThat, though, is another issue. The knuckle-dragging minority in the Wembley stands don’t deserve any mention beyond a passing one.\n\nHenderson, though, certainly does. Yet, as is usually the case, his contribution has gone under the radar.\n\nWhile all eyes will be on Sterling’s return to the side in Kosovo today, little will be said of the Liverpool skipper’s continued absence, this time through a virus.\n\nWith qualification sealed, it won’t matter.

But he actually did retire on the bus on the way home and that really sunk in because it was a moment like, ‘Oh my God, that’s his last chance’.\n\n“It was my first tournament and when it’s your first tournament you think there will be loads.\n\n“I think, to be frank, this group is slightly different because I think most of the players that played on Thursday are going to peak in two or four years’ time.\n\n“So there’s a reality of where we might be as a team, in terms of what’s possible.\n\n“But we have to find a way to get the maximum out of them, as we did, I think, two summers ago and let’s see how far we can get.”\n\n5\n\nBut when asked how special it was to manage such a talented group, Southgate recalled what happened to England’s last so-called golden generation.\n\nThe Three Lions boss said: “I would imagine that Sven-Goran Eriksson thought the same of Beckham, Scholes, Carrick, Gerrard, Lampard . . .\n\n“So, you know, if you’re the England manager, you’re normally in a reasonably privileged position.\n\n“I think we have given young players their opportunity ahead of their time, which has given us a greater depth.”\n\nAfter 33 goals in seven qualifiers, England are flying as an attacking force — with Harry Kane having scored 11 goals in seven matches and aiming to score in every match in this group.\n\nBut despite weak opposition, England have proved themselves to be defensively dodgy, as the Kosovans proved by scoring three times in their defeat at Southampton in December.\n\nHammerings of Bulgaria and Montenegro in their last two outings, by an aggregate score of 13-0, have done little to calm fears about England’s backline.\n\nJoe Gomez might well have started here — yet after his bust-up with Raheem Sterling on Monday, the Liverpool defender injured his knee in training on Friday in a freak clash with Kieran Trippier.\n\nAt least England can expect a warm welcome in Pristina for this dead rubber.\n\nGareth Southgate will make changes for Kosovo game\n\nKosovo is an unusual sort of nation — one which actually likes the English, due to Tony Blair’s key role in winning independence from Serbia.\n\nAnd Southgate says his men felt the love on their way from the airport yesterday evening.\n\nHe said: “We’ve had an incredible welcome from the local people and also it was lovely to see some of our troops who came out to see us at the airport as well.”", "authors": ["Dave Kidd", "Chief Sports Writer"], "publish_date": "2019-11-16 22:30:37", "images": ["https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id337710261?pt=263124&ct=smartappbanner2019acq&mt=8", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.6 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.5 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SPORT-PREVIEW-Southgate-and-England-Kids-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 0.7 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead_mobile.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.4 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=752905198150451&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": "sport"}

I think he will let it run out and take that option of being a free agent next summer.\n\n“So if he doesn’t want to stay and has made up his mind to go, I’d be looking to play someone else now.\n\n“If he doesn’t want to be part of the team, it’s very difficult — you want people who want to play for the club — and it’s time to say right, OK.”\n\n3 Harry Redknapp thinks it's time Spurs got tough with Eriksen Credit: PA:Press Association\n\nFORM HAS SLUMPED\n\nEriksen has been one of the Premier League’s shining lights in recent campaigns and starred in Spurs’ run to the Champions League final last season.\n\nBut things have unravelled at the North London club since, with Pochettino’s team lying 14th in the league after just three wins.\n\nEriksen has struggled this season after failing to force a move away last summer.\n\nHe has made just seven starts and did not feature in last week’s home draw with Sheffield United — though he did score twice for Denmark against Gibraltar on Friday.\n\nRedknapp added: “He’s a great player, no doubt. He’s a fantastic footballer, but his form of late has been poor.\n\n“He’s not in form and wants to leave at the end of the year — he’s stated quite plainly he is keen to go, even though Tottenham must have offered him a new contract.”\n\nTWO OTHERS SET TO GO TOO\n\nSpurs face a battle to hang on to a string of key first-team players, with defenders Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld — who like Eriksen are free agents in the summer — also currently on course to depart.\n\nLast week left-back Danny Rose vowed he will not be forced out until his deal ends in 2021 after the club opened the door for him to go last year.\n\nEriksen, who moved from Ajax to Tottenham in 2013, had been a target for Manchester United but is understood to favour a move to Spain. Yet neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona put in a bid last summer.\n\nRedknapp — who led Spurs to the Champions League quarter-finals in 2011 during a four-year stint — reckons Eriksen holds all the aces as his contract runs down.\n\nHe added: “You get to January and see if you can sell him then. But he probably won’t move then because, if he hangs on until the summer and sees his contract out, he’s a free agent.\n\n“Let’s say his value is £50million. When he is a free agent he can go to a club and his agent will say his value is £50m if you bought him.\n\n“Now you are getting him for nothing, so you give him £25m and you will still have a bargain.\n\n“So somebody will give him a big signing-on fee plus his wages, so he is really going to set himself up for life by hanging on now.\n\n“He has gone this far.

I’m sure it’ll help his team.”\n\nI’ve been in touch with him during this process of changing the format. I know he’s a true believer of the Davis Cup and what this competition means for tennis. Gerard Pique on Andy Murray\n\nMurray thought his career was over in January when he broke down in tears at the Australian Open in Melbourne.\n\nAnd Pique, 32, a former Manchester United centre-back, said: “I watched his five-set match in Melbourne and was devastated when he took the microphone and he said (he was retiring).\n\n“I’m very happy for him and his comeback.\n\n“I’ve been in touch with him during this process of changing the format. I know he’s a true believer of the Davis Cup and what this competition means for tennis.\n\n“Last year in Rome, I was meeting with Andy, and other players of the ATP Player Council. I’ve had different messages with him. He gives a lot of importance to Davis Cup.”\n\nThe significant change to the format, the scrapping of home-and-away knockout matches, is a huge risk for the ITF following Kosmos’ 25-year £2.6billion investment.\n\nThere is also the absurdity of a new team tournament, the ATP Cup, starting less than six weeks later in Australia.\n\nMurray last week expressed concerns the new tournament could lack the same atmosphere of its previous incarnation and tickets sales might be difficult for travelling Brits.\n\nPLENTY OF SUPPORT\n\nPique, married to Colombian singer Shakira, said: “Britain is the country that bought more tickets apart from Spain. So, he’ll have this atmosphere that he wants.\n\n“One of the key things we want is to preserve is this atmosphere that the Davis Cup always had.\n\n“About 70 per cent of fans in Spain and 30 per cent of fans out of Spain are coming to follow their country.\n\n“Some sessions are already sold out. And the final, semi-finals and quarter-finals are close to sold out.\n\n“We have already nearly 100,000 tickets and 100 per cent full of occupancy is 130,000.\n\n“On Monday I’m sure definitely it will be the start of a magnificent event.”\n\nBy quirk of fate in the La Liga calendar, Barcelona will be in Madrid next Saturday when they face Leganes.\n\nPique is trying to arrange tickets for Barca players to cheer on their fellow countrymen – and will try to persuade Messi to go, too.\n\nHe said: “Ivan Rakitic wants to watch Croatia on Monday.

Dreams do come true. Stefanos Tsitsipas\n\nThere was a rare moment in the fourth and ninth games of the second set where Federer offered resistance and threatened to take this match possibly into a deciding set.\n\nBut any chance of a fightback was short-lived because Tsitsipas kept asking the difficult questions, kept probing and shifting Federer around the court with his exquisite range of short-making.\n\nThe Athens sensation secured his passage and second ever win over Federer with a 131mph ace.\n\nTsitsipas, who saved 11 of 12 break points, said: “Playing Roger is the biggest honour I can. Today’s victory is probably one of my best matches of this season. These are the moments I always wait for and moments I want to prove the best out of my game\n\n“It’s not easy to copy Federer. I mean this guy does magic on the court. For me, I am trying to do half of what he does. He can be so good sometimes.\n\n“Obviously we have different games. I have a one-handed backhand. He does, too. We come in different shapes and sizes. Dominic is in our community, too, let’s call it.\n\n“It’s good to see one-handed backhands are alive. I can learn so much.\n\n“Now I am living the dream. I remember myself being one of these kids watching the event and I couldn’t picture myself being here. Dreams do come true.\"\n\nAnd there will be a new champion of the ATP Finals - and they will have a single-handed backhand.\n\nLatest tennis news Live Blog Thiem vs Zverev live Latest updates from the ATP semi-final Exclusive MUZZ HAVE A CHANCE Pique backs Murray to lead GB to Davis Cup glory... with Messi watching NEXT GEN'S TIME Federer warns Nadal and Djokovic Big Three's dominance may be over in 2020 Live Blog ATP FINALS LIVE Federer LOSES to Tsitsipas in the semis in straight sets TENNIS FINALE ATP Finals: Live stream, TV channel, match schedule, who is playing at O2?

A Prime Minister that works for the many, and not the few.\"\n\nThe shock clip was produced by thinktank and research lab Future Advocacy, based in London.\n\n5 In another phoney clip, Boris Johnson appears to endorse Jeremy Corbyn Credit: Future Advocacy\n\nThose behind the expertly-crafted fake said they hoped to raise awareness about the power deepfakes hold to spread fake news.\n\nSuch technologies can fuel misinformation and skew election results, yet no new laws are in place to stop them.\n\nIn another of the firm's deepfake videos, the roles are reversed, with Johnson backing Corbyn to lead the country.\n\n\"Since that momentous day in 2016, division has coursed through our country as we argue with fantastic passion, vim and vigour about Brexit,\" the bogus Johnson says.\n\n5 Fortunately, the real BoJo's still got his senses about him Credit: PA:Press Association/PA Images\n\n\"My friends, I wish to rise above this divide and endorse my worthy opponent, the Right Honourable Jeremy Corbyn, to be Prime Minister of our United Kingdom.\n\n\"Only he, not I, can make Britain great again.\"\n\nDeepfakes are made using computers that generate convincing phoney photos or video of events that never happened.\n\nAI is used to manipulate real footage of someone – often a celebrity – to make them do whatever the creator wants.\n\n5 Will Smith's face swapped onto the character of Neo in The Matrix using deepfake tech Credit: YouTube\n\nThousands of pictures of a victim's face are fed into the AI, which then coughs out a photo-realistic fake that, with the help of a voice actor, you can make say almost anything.\n\nClips require meticulous research into what sort of language a target repeatedly uses in order to put together a believable script.\n\nThe videos are often striking in their accuracy – to the untrained eye, they could be perfectly real.\n\nFuture Advocacy's election fakes were not designed to fool voters, but to act as a warning about the rise of deepfake technology.\n\nDeepfakes – what are they, and how do they work? Here's what you need to know... Deepfakes are phoney videos of people that look perfectly real\n\nThey're made using computers to generate convincing representations of events that never happened\n\nOften, this involves swapping the face of one person onto another, or making them say whatever you want\n\nThe process begins by feeding an AI hundreds or even thousands of photos of the victim\n\nA machine learning algorithm swaps out certain parts frame-by-frame until it spits out a realistic, but fake, photo or video\n\nIn one famous deepfake clip, comedian Jordan Peele created a realistic video of Barack Obama in which the former President called Donald Trump a \"dipsh*t\"\n\nIn another, the face of Will Smith was pasted onto the character of Neo in the action flick The Matrix. Smith famously turned down the role to star in flop movie Wild Wild West, while the Matrix role went to Keanu Reeves\n\n\"I think I may be one of the thousands of deepfakes on the internet using powerful technologies to tell stories that aren't true,\" the sham Corbyn admits in the video.\n\n\"Technologies like these can fuel misinformation, threaten our individual liberties and undermine elections.\n\n\"Yet, no new laws are in place to govern them. Things have to change.\n\n\"Help Future Advocacy route out DeepFakes.\"\n\n5 Deepfake technology has also been used to create false porn videos of celebs like Arianna Grande (computer-generated image) Credit: Fake App\n\nDeepfakes have previously been used to create realistic clips of celebrities.\n\nIn one famous example, comedian Jordan Peele created a deepfake of Barack Obama in which the former President called Donald Trump a \"dipsh*t\".\n\nIn another, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg was falsely portrayed boasting he could \"control the future\" thanks to stolen data.\n\nDeepfake tech has also been used to make creepy \"revenge porn\" videos in which the face of an ex-lover is pasted onto the body of an adult actress.\n\nFAKE VIEWS fears as 'perfectly real' deepfakes just 6 months away – and these shocking video fakes could ruin your life\n\nIn other news, a Samsung deepfake of a talking Mona Lisa painting laid bare the terrifying new frontier in fake news in August.\n\nThis creepy AI creates photo-realistic models and outfits from scratch.\n\nTOP STORIES IN TECH WHATSAPP HACK WhatsApp denies bug ‘could have let hackers install spyware on YOUR phone’ EARLY BIRD The best iPhone XR Black Friday 2019 deals GADGETS GALORE Black Friday Tech Deals 2019 - Carphone Warehouse, TalkTalk and Fonehouse game the system The best gaming deals on Black Friday 2019 Hot Deals i-spy iPhone XR with 75GB data costs just £36pm in Black Friday deal with no cost up front NOW YOU SEE IT...

We don't know too much about either yet.\n\nApparently, Blizzard is letting Overwatch and Overwatch 2 players battle one another in online combat.\n\nIt's a little unconventional, but would mean the original game's strong player base doesn't take too much of a dent when the new one's released.\n\nOverwatch – a brief history Here's what you need to know... Overwatch is a hugely popular online first-person shooter\n\nIt's a hero-based game where players choose to control one of more than 30 characters, each with different abilities and playstyles\n\nBlizzard first revealed the game in 2014, but didn't launch it until May 24, 2016\n\nIt was originally put together using assets and concepts from Blizzard's failed MMORPG 'Titan'\n\nPlayers in the game work together to secure and defend control points, or escort payloads across a map\n\nThe game is played by tens of millions of fans, and has even spawned a popular esports scene\n\nBy July 2019, Overwatch players had spent more than one billion dollars in game according to estimates\n\n5 New characters could be added to the game's line-up of playable heroes Credit: Blizzard\n\nOverwatch 2 release date – when is it out?\n\nIt's not yet clear when Overwatch 2 will hit shelves.\n\nBlizzard said the sequel is is \"in development\" and that more details will be coming soon.\n\nThe first Overwatch game was announced in 2014, but didn't go on sale until 2016.\n\nHowever, we'd expect a smaller gap this time around – perhaps around one year maximum.\n\nOverwatch Reunion animated short introduces new hero Ashe - and her robot pal Bob\n\nIn other news, we tracked down the cheapest Call of Duty Modern Warfare deals so far.\n\nSony recently confirmed the PS5 release date as coming before Christmas 2020.\n\nA recent \"price leak\" suggests that the PS5 could cost £250 more than its predecessor.\n\nMOST READ IN GAMING game the system The best gaming deals on Black Friday 2019 GAME OVER Fortnite cheat FaZe Jarvis is leaving £11.6M LA mansion and going back home to UK switch it up Nintendo Switch price comes CRASHING down for Black Friday and Cyber Monday FORTNITE FORCE Star Wars has invaded Fortnite with a Stormtrooper skin and Star Destroyer GAME OVER?

Do you want your most personal information transferred to Google? I think a lot of people would say no.”\n\nGoogle's recent acquisition of FitBit has now come under scrutiny as that will also give it access to the health data of millions of people.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition Google tried to reassure any concerned users and said that it would \"never sell personal data to anyone\".\n\nThe exposure of Project Nightingale has brought up debate about Google and FitBit on social media again.\n\nEditor of two smart tech publications Hugh Langley said: \"*This* is why Google bought Fitbit.\n\n\"The big picture is about getting closer to patients, not about the Apple Watch.\n\n\"But the deal is already under a lot of scrutiny by some regulators – this story validates those concerns. Could slow things in 2020?\"\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Google's end goal of the medical data collection is to create a search tool that will combine patient data.\n\nOn the other hand, Ascension is said to be aiming to mine patient data to identify if any additional tests are necessary or find out if there are other ways to generate more revenue from the patients.\n\nHow to view what Google knows about you You can take the following steps...
